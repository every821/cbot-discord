I cannot wait for schizo lez
Lmao
we are just having a convo when he chimes in: "Pls bet on Shon my goodness, you son of a bitch I'm in for kissing my kenya baby"
im imaginging him being like our lil schizo friend
big lez will speak his first words in no time
easier said than done but hell yeah
Just gotta piece it together
a lot of pre-built building blocks
Yeah, it should be easy
so its really high level programming if you know what i mean
I am excited
and you control it/play around with it using python packages
but the model is all pre-built
kinda  a last filter on the model output
Hahaha
called "massaging" the data lol
apparently the biggest problem with it is to control the output so it doesnt have too much repetition, randomness, run-on sentences, etc
theres small models too
Jesus
160,000 books*
5Mb max
We probably have like
Holy damn
thats like 4000 books
text
wow you can choose different model sizes, the largest model, used for AI Dungeon 2, used 40GB of tex
good chance
I'm wondering if I slept wrong
got it bad from sleeping funny
It sucks
i hate neck pain
But I think it needs a computer break
And I wish my neck would stop hurting
I wish I could finish this dump
That's amazing
on how to download it and train it on your own data
they give like spoonfed hand holding instructions the whole way
if you read that collab link, it really doesnt look like using this model will be hard, and its literally built for exactly this
It shouldn't be too hard I think
The API for discord is actually really good
hardest part is integrating it into a discord both i think
like one day
this looks more and mroe like it could be a super easy project man...
Haha yeah I like programming a lot
your body tires before the mind
Ah nice, crazy how you can do like 12 hours of programming a day and not get tired of it
But my neck started hurting a lot so I had to stop using my computer
Dump
And yes! Still trying to stop the dumo
Haha
You do anything to your raw data tn?
lol
i havent yet downloaded python on new PC
This might be the best path to take
Oh! No way
You can retrain the model on new text by downloading it

https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/356305/Creating_the_everimprovising_text_adventures_of_AI_Dungeon_2.php
just make an AI Dungeon Bot
you could theoretically just use its model i think... kinda cheating
<@!136253782131474432> so AIDunegon2 is built on giant machine learning model made by OpenAI called GPT-2
Night haha
thanks lol goodnight
Got is a perfect candidate
Enjoy your foreskin dreams, oh absolutely
thats no doubt a real thing
youre saying that as a joke but like
No problem any time im here all night
oh nooo
I like it when daddy god stomps on me and vores me
thanks for that
well im gunna dream about foreskins tonight
Daddy thou art in heaven
masochist fetish?
unless you want the holy father to punish you, yes daddy
hahah
Stay at the church and pray with everyone there for God to please stop punishing you
im sure its real
going to see some ancient bleeding foreskin for moral support
its the 1400s, just tryna keep the plague doctors at bay
hahah
Like how are you not doubting things at that point
just random foreskins
lol
or something
10-14
I personally like that they had multiple foreskins of Christ going at the same time
everyone lets go see a 1000yo bleeding foreskin on our vacation
It wants to be freed from the mortal realm
A special chapel was constructed and processions organised in honour of the miraculous relic, which became the goal of pilgrimages
It's crying
a 1000 yo foreskin apparently started bleeding
Stop it oh my god
this is 1000 years after he was born
The foreskin
What
it started bleeding
ew
"This prepuce became famous when the bishop of Cambray, during the celebration of the Mass, saw three drops of blood blotting the linens of the altar."
Could you
No you can't
you could get foreskin tuburculosis>
Blessed foreskin
Holy Foreskin of Rome
Like so you didn't get the consumption in your foreskin and die at age 2
Wasn't this normal back then
Why was him being circumsized an event
Delicious
this makes it sound like they are eating it
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_the_Circumcision_of_Christ
Eating foreskin and blood
Religious people are crazy
Things with like, Jesus' hair and all kinds of shit
pope blood
mmm
someone drank pope blood once i think
There's a lot of weird things like that
religions is so fucked
Delicious
this is so fucked that its a thing
OH
Hello
done
Right click I think
how do we change a nickname on discord
I don't know
why do you know about this
what the fuck brianna
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Prepuce
thats the most cursed story i have ever heard
Tastes like dreams and dust
juicy holy baby foreskin
And it's at the Vatican I think
preserved after 2020 years
And said it tasted fantastic
oh, my, fucking, what
Like licked what was believed to be baby Jesus' foreskin
There was a thing where this lady
spirtiually
Ok I'm pretty sure
Uh oh
what if you have a baby jesus fetish
!?!??!????
I would suck Jesus dick
BRIANNA
WAIT
wait
I have a jesus fetish
spiritually my connection to god is technically a fetish
That's for later
thats a can of worms
oh no spiritually
And physically it's a fruit
But spiritually it's a vegetable
atomically its just atoms
chemicaly its just a bunch of carbs
And we fight about how it's socially a vegetable
exactly
yes
hahah
Generally yeah, it's like how socially a tomato is a vegetable but scientifically it's a fruit
i agree with you more than I was letting on
just a misunderstanding
there is no winning
thats why noone wins
haha we often are
we just have different styles of communicating, very different ways of presenting the same information i think
That we're fighting on the same side
Nick says that all the time
but most of the time we are actually on the same page
I think our lil fight club moments are stressful
at least I certainly dont want to make you feel bad
but its wholesome that we know we dont want to upset each other
we do that sometimes
Okay sounds good me too hah
It's okay I know you weren't trying to be rude, and we got off on a tangent that's why I wanted to stop
I think 99% we were on a different page about the semantic context, that is how we are breaking up the question, not the answer to the argument..
yeah about above when you thought i was being rude, when I said "youre right i guess" or whatever along those lines, its because I was googling the terminology to see if we were miscommunicating about a different understanding of definition, not a simple understanding of belief, sorry I re-read it after and realised it sounds rude without that context...
of course
Your bad if you act on it
less complicated than a list
I like how you put it
Yeah!
that seems like it makes senses to me
Sexual Deviations (from a biological norm): Different orientations, fetishes, harmful disorders (necrophilia, murder, pedophilia)
Sexual Orientations: Gay, straight, etc.
Sexual Fetishes (harmless deviations): Foot fetish, train fetish, etc.
We don't, ultimately we agree that pedophilia doesn't make you a bad person you're just sick and need help
The way you have described it recently
I really dont think we actually disagree
just trying to understand each other
im not trying to "win"
Im not trying to debate, just trying to understand and get on the same page
It's good in debates not
Oh
That's cheap and doesn't get your point across it just derails things
I think we miscommunicated though because I agree with you as you decribe it now
To play into miscommunication or whatever
So I come across rude when I dont want to be so sorry about that
But that's not fair
Im a bad texter too
I hate miscommunicaiton, and I play into it with my style
Sorry about that
Whereas we largely believe the same thing
I think we were just on different pages about our choices of words was all!
a semantic misalignment
Your not supposed to want to dangerously wound yourself or others
I think it was a simple miscommunication based on terminology
No, I think I can agree with what you are proposing
I agree though that its different from a fetish if we define fetishes as non-harmful sexual deviations
And when it starts to upset me it's worse and I try to back away from it lets just agree to disagree
I believe this disorder, while clearly different and severe and horrendous, however has similar roots (causes) (purely biologically), as other sexual deviations.
No it's fine I just don't want to keep going I'm tired this is a heavy subject for me I only have so much fuel for it
I agree that it is a disorder
Ill agree with you instead
Okay you dont have to agree with me
Wanting to be murdered is absolutely a disorder
the answer to WHY is similar on a biological scale
I just wanted to stop because this is really tiring of a subject for me I can't go and go until we reach a consensus which seems to be me agreeing with you,, i don't think it's a fetish because it's a disorder
the answer to WHAT is a clear different
why is [other person] a foot fetishist
why is [person] a pedo
I tried by using the word "mechanism" I am only tackling the "why"
thats the only thing I have been attempting to address but i havent been explaining it well enough apprently
the big question of "How does one become a pedo" vs "How does one become a MILF lover, or foot fetishist"
Before it got out of hand and I started being told I'm misunderstanding , I'm really not I just disagree
I think the only thing you are not on the same page about is the mechanism for some reason
that the morality is different
I don't think your a bad person I don't think your a fan of pedophilia but this is getting taxing and I wanted to stop
I agree that the result is different
i agree there are differences in outcome
I agree that pedophilia is harmful whereas most fetishes are not
I am trying to clarify to get on the same page
I didnt mean to be patronising either
This is very patronizing Findlay
IN person you would have gaged that
I think you are reading into the tone of the messages a bit too much, I didnt intend to come across rudely
I do not know the definition of 'fetish' as you see it. so I wont use that word
I dont appreciate the way you spoke to me just now
I agree that is is not an sexual orientation
And I asked to stop this argument because it's taxing for me
Mine is that it's not because it's got a lot of differences that I think rather make it a disorder
Fukin rude but whatever
Damn ok
Your opinion is it is classified as one
okay whatever you want
It's not that's my point
...
But it's not a fetish
its still a biological change
but before the age of 25 before the brain finishses developing
Same with most fetishes
But it's usually stemmed from having it happen to you
Nature vs Nurture yes
They can be
Well pedophiles are also not TYPICALLY born either
my argumetn is concerned ONLY with MECHANISM (why it happens), not with RESULT (what happens)
Foot fetishes are the most common because in our part of the brain where we 'sense' the different areas of our body, the genitals and feet region of the brain are directly adjacent, and sometimes early in development some neurons cross over and fire together, interesting as you can see directly WHY it happens on a biological scale. For body fetishes, this gives a clear comparison and mechanism, tied to the area of pleasure related to sensory stimulation. Many fetishses are more social like milfs, but occur in the social regions of the brain, with the parental regions being crossed over into the pleasure centre, all of these biologically stem from the same KINDS of biological errors. Some yield things that are pretty innocuous. Who cares if you are into feet. Some are pretty horrendous, being into kids is fucked, but its happens from some of the same BIOLOGICAL reasons, and that is the only case i was trying to make
It's also like a lack of empathy and all kinds of wild wild things that aren't good for the group as a whole
It's just not really supposed to happen but it DOES because sometimes the brain go whoop and now you like diddling the boys in the gym locker room
Make them bad mothers kill them ect.
It hurts the race in that sex with young can cause problems in the future
I don't think it's even wrong because it's morally wrong
fancy way of saying that morally you are correct
of course we think its 'wrong'. but just be careful with the words right and wrong in science, science knows no morality. it becomes an is-ought fallacy
No no but I just don't think they're really all that comparable personally and I don't like the comparison, my main point is that pedophilia is not just a fetish
thats all i was ever saying. I knew you also said that, for some reason you latched onto the thought that i was saying gays === pedos. when i was simply saying pedos and gay boths have devatied pleasure centres
But they have something very very wrong in their head that transcends average fetish territory
I am in complete agreement that pedophiles need help
very different deviations
of course they are different deviations! finally making some ground
And even if that is the case one which hurts our young is a different deviation from just simply sex no produce bab
event*
if any law discriminates against a person for being what they were simply born as, its wrong without supoprting that person to change in the even they are a monstrosity like a pedo
Also we have now desecrated the bot chat
I’ll leave you too it. Good luck in the fight club Maaties, and to all a good night
I think you kinda latched onto something i wasnt even conveying...
It's just, not a sexuality and not really comparable to homosexuality
I think you missed my point....
Lower that anxiety to 0
No its not about disagreeing, i think you think we are argunig about something we are not
Maybe if I popped a xan we could go wild
anyways brianna, i dont ever want to appear to say Pedophilia is okay, or is the same as being gay, i was not entertaining that comparison even. the only point i was trying to assert was that biologically, the pleasure centre in the brain undergoes deviations from the norm in both cases, and in both cases that is not a concious decisions
Plus finn I think we should agree to disagree because I feel you're not really seeing my point and while I see yours I disagree with it and this is kind of triggering me
Oh yea. The walls were all squiggly and kept seeing the shadow people dancing 💃🏻 in the corner of my eyes
Do you see the people yet
Sean
oh god shon
Man I feel like I could come in and talk with nature vs nurture and morals and social vs biological but I’m currently sitting on my 38th hour of being awake
neither does being gay
That having sex with children does not fulfill the purpose we are supposed to have which is sex to procreate
what has deviated from the norm in the brain
disregard the horrific nature of the subject, and look only at the mechanism
of course it is, but youre getting too caught up in values
Instinct and what not
It's biologically important if we're talking about like
yeah but its a different topic
okay, im aware of those differences clearly
Sexual maturity is important
No they don't but that's ignoring too many other aspects that DO make it different
im not touching the idea of consent, sexual maturity, none of that
im asking if one aspect of it is the same
im not saying they are the same
No they're not the same.
do people choose to be pedos, yes or no
that doesnt answer the question
what
It's not really comparative because even if they're gay theyre pursuing sexually mature mates
but you must agree people dont choose to be pedos, jsut as mush as they dont choose to be gay
Of course it is
It's really about opinion here I think ,
I listened to a really interested documentary about it
It's a grey area more on the edge of disorder
"Mental illness" are not black and white delineations, there is no definitive and universal dictionary of what is an illness and what is normal, that is an ideological, social, and cultural question. There are obvious things on one end of the spectrum like depression, pedophilia, and less obvious things like OCD, synesthesia, etc
I'm just saying that I don't think that pedophilia is really a fetish black and white
Having a foot fetish is not mental illness but having sex with underdeveloped children is because your not supposed to want that
thats the key point
this classification is an ideological, socio-cultural one. I was classifying biologcally as to assert the point that these people do not choose to be gay, to have a fetish, or to be a pedo, its the same mechanism, some wiring is different than the norm
No I don't give a shit about the morality i mean I do but it's different and has differences caused by imbalances and mental illnesses that are NOT common or natural therefore I don't think it should be in the same category
Ah yea. Socially it is required for binding as a pact, and modern day culture. Biologically it’s meaningless.
i was trying to spell out my position just so i didnt imply i was saying consent didnt matter socio-culturally
i definitely never said it did
Like there are fetishes you can classify as fetishes but we have to acknowledge that there is a difference
i agree shon
yeah
I will say that consent means noting biologically. If anything, consent risks not gaining a new offspring. Just putting that out there for your 1 points fin
i think youre hung up a little bit on bias of what is "right and wrong" instead of what simply is
Your not supposed to want to do that either haha
fucking animals = cant make kids, cant consent
I'm saying it's a problem in the brain and therefore different from average fetishes and it's ABSOLUTELY not a sexuality
fucking feet = cant make kids, can consent
fucking kids == big bad, wrong, cant make kids, cant consent
fetishes / sexuality
No I know
Like we're supposed to be WIRED to not want to have sex with them
biologically
Becuase it leads to no future offspring.
Im saying its no different than other fetishes
I know Brianna
They're under developed
Biology, homosexuality and asexual its is a mistake.
Sex characteristics
Uhh
Biologically it makes no sense because they also have no like
I know hehe
and lol i was being devils advocate
ideologically, you can classify it how you like
Uh oh
One more and ur out
That’s your second anti gay strike fin
If it is a danger to the person then it's a problem because your not acting with proper self preservation
biologically, the mechanism is not different, thats all im saying
And obviously murder and general EXTREME pain causing fetishes are classified as disorders
that arhument can be used to be anti gay...
if its man on man
or other men....
neither can old ladies or dogs or helicopters
And children cannot have babies they are the babies
Because we're supposed to have sex for babies ultimately
out of*
you dont get anything about of 90% of fetishses
Because we don't get anything out of it
or murder people
biologically we arent supposed to fuck animals or amusment parks or eat poo
We aren't supposed to want to
Biologically we're not supposed to have sex with children
im talking about biological rules
Well yes obviously but I mean like
those are societal rules
youre not supposed to do a lot of things
Yeah like the murder one is
everything is a disorder
many fetishes are disorders....
Because your not supposed to want to have sex with children
well semantically maybe, but im talking about physiologically (biologically) as to make the point that you do not chose to be a pedophile
It's a disorder
No but it's not classified as a fetish
some fetishes are literally based around the other person not having it (rape fetish)
I don't think it's classified as one for certain reasons
fetishes dont imply consent
fucked one*
Ever theyre babbies
still a fetish though, just a fuckd done
of course not
A child cannot consent
No haha but at least in this case it's a possibility
okay well buy and large thats not the case lol
And some have obviously it's been MURDER cases I could find the story it's very fucked up about this woman who really wanted to be murdered
same wiring in the brain gone amiss
right, well pedos breach consent, but the mechanism for why they are attracted to the awful thing is the same as any other fetish i bet
They can consent to the play of it
or animals .....
i doubt adults consent to being murdered or raped
most fetishes revolve around being a sub or dom, its about power roles, which freudian theory says stems back to parental dynamics
All of which or well..... Kinda can have consenting adults participating
suffocation
Rarely it's just about the sex it's about the power
necrophilia
murder fetishes
theres rape fetishes too...
I disagree in that people with pedophilic tendancies have these urges that aren't just about sexy
or fuck amusement park rides
or eat poo
or fuck animals
we are not supposed to want to be consumed
we just (for obvious reason) classify this as COMPLETELY and correctly unacceptable, but it doesnt make the mechanism different
We're not supposed to want to be with our young
its the same mechanism
but physiologically i doubt theres a difference
Verge but there's a difference
yeah...
A disorder
many fetishses verge on mental health disorders
Nnno it's classified as like
I think its still probably a fetish.... is it not
repression likely makes it worse and more likely for it to be acted upon
It's definitely different from a sexuality and a fetish
so in effect those people just need help to manager their conditions to be less of a risk to society
you dont choose to be gay, you dont choose to be a furry (I think), and unfortuntaley i doubt you choose to be a pedo either
And they need to be allowed to get it
They need therapy
yeah i agree
It's a mental disorder
true
No I agree I don't really like the crime of looking at art of fake people who don't exist and don't have real ages really
and not be jailed for having that condition, unless its acted upon
i say they should voluntarily add themselves to a government registry
see they arent a danger to others if they dont act on it... so not sure abou the morality there
Which I don't agree with hot takes hot takes
Yes they are
or am i wrong
pedophiles are sometimes jailed for having cartoons though right
Not enough
Which is
fo sho
Pedophiles sometimes only get 10-15
yeah
IMO
It's ish because that person is a danger to others
but still
i guess 4 years is a decent sentence considering theft over $1000 is like only a year
Yeah my Uber driver was a little odd today, nice but odd
always just wait until they say your name first
Idk why
Sex crimes don't seem to get much jail time
I took an Uber today and it had me very scared
thats fucked
he only got 4 years
That's scary too

Your phone means business
Yeah they do
Which is kinda funny
Mine sometimes sound like.. emails
Also these messages will be included...
I'm confused by mine
So this is one method the bot could use to speak
They are based on your past messages
These are literally Markov chains
and its how it tries to speak
for it to learn from
and feed them to the bot
I feel like we shoudl compile all of these sentences

lmao
so the moment I knew of this I did all of that
to increase passive income
then buy small tavrens around the city
you can pay money and do quests to fix it up
Within like the first few missions you are intetroduced to a run down tavren
Hahaha how did you do that
Greed is good...
Greed Is Good baby
Also reminds me: In AC:Unity there is a way to passivly get money. I maxed out the passive income the moment I could, not doing any story missions or side quests until it was done.

There is rng, but every time it loses the winrate goes up by like 1-5%, and vice versa.
thats what i meant
yep
And pusudo rng, where it will achieve a “48% winrate” by intentionally winning and failing as it gets screwed one way or another.
one type is pretty fake, relies on like how many times its failed or passed in the past
True rng, which I think the bot is
Now there are 2 types of rng
So many different factors that make it impossible to predict
yeah
Yea, but most of the time they follow a string that is tied to like 3 parts of the server pc. Time, internal temp, and something else.
its jsut "seeminingly random"
Random number generators are never atcually random for computers
hhah I know, but this bot might not follow true stats
Don’t
Statistics done work that way :p

cell phone can be used to call cops on someone, and fail the robbery within 15 mins or something

0% chance of success with only 1

Yea.
Right, but the multiplier makes sure thats super unlikely
Unless those wins give 50% each :p
which means youd make 50k
Youll win usually 10 out of 15 times
if you dont get super unlucky
and chances are youll make a shit load
and then bet 9999 15 times
you can drink and eat them until successsful
but when you have 150k in the bank, and 0 in wallet
But you can die
Search can give more then beg
Yea. Just like search
but drinking, eating tide pods, and stuff, have chances to kill you
means you win 70% of the time or soemthing, and have returns 25% higher than normal
usualy only the richest partake in that, when compounded with huge multipliers
yeah, makes odds at gambling better but is super risky
Also I could get fuggin wasted
Yes, it’s possible to liquidate it later
Brianna died of dog cancer when using search, and searching a dog
if you die too

you could have an automated account to just spam beg every 5 secs
Hm or bet every 5 seconds

pls bet 1

pls bet 1
probably more effecient to just beg every 50 secs though
True hah
Yes, then you would always make money
You will always get either 200-300%
So you could just keep beeting one coin and make income
200-300
When you bet only 1 coin
But
When you win, you usually gain anywhere from 50% to 150% of the bet (average)
Multiplier affects the return
Ahhh, when you win its between 55-300% of bet
When betting, you have around a 53% chance of losing or something. When you lose you always lose 100% of the bet.
Whats that?

love that
aw
and hahah
because its just so cute
oh nooo
theres literally an octopus with like its latin name as adorabilis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgDE2DOICuc
and stopped eating it and never ate it ever again since
i was munching on these thingys that dan got at a restaurant when he was down and i knew it was squid or whatever,,,, then i looked at it and realized they were like.... SHAPED like little squids
i did too
it was just called seafood salad
i didnt realise it was octopus
i ate octopus once and i was so sad
i like them less than octopus
idk why
squid are.... less my favorite
squids are smart too, but not all
theyre very smart
octopi are probably like tied tbh
theyre very very cute
(cuttlefish are the most intelligent of the cephalopods (its argued) which are the most intelligent of all invertebrates
octopi are absolutely my favorite little lads
they get lonely and hang out with fish
aww
Although believed to not be the most social of animals, many cephalopods are in fact highly social creatures; when isolated from their own kind, some species have been observed shoaling with fish.[16]
because thats just awful to go out and kill them
yeah im gunna go with that
probably no faster than a shell
maybe they wash up like shells
when it disintigrate YES
decompsoe
you know
uuuh
its an invertebrate after all
yeah so it probably doesnt like
so not really a bone
its like the same material as a snail shell
so it probably doesnt like
its a bone right?
im gunna hope its from dead ones...
thats true i didnt think of that!
how many uses does it have other than for turtles and snails
im sure they dont just go out and fish and kill them for their cuttlebone right
maybe its from cuttlefish who die
im sure there are other ways to give the snails calcium
:((((
dogs
they are like as smart as fogs
watched such a cute video about a cuttlefish
i made myself sad
pigs, octopus, cuttlefish
they kill a lot of smart animals
wellllll
but you can give it to snails too to help their calcium
killing smart creatures
its for turtles
cuttlefish are so intelligent D;
thats what the man said
im not sure...
why use a cuttle bone thats so sad
i just realised
wait im super against this
and he said they all died :c
and i went to get a new one
oh cool!
you supposed to give them cuttle bone
they munch it!
yeah i guess if the water isnt hard enough, he cant build his shell
thats very very cute
and then suddenly just died
booking an appointment for your snail
because he was doing super super well
hahah can you imagine
i went to petsmart and was talking to a lad and he said it was probably calcium deficiency
Hahahaha
He's somewhere in the sewers
Dr. Snendre Bingus (DVM), Snail Vet
hes very dead
Can you fly Ida down to check our snail
hahaha the snail?
oh wow hahah did you get a vet to looka t him (jokign)
They press themselves against the filter entrance but they're way too big to go right in
all cured and no deaths
and yessir
and the snail had a calcium deficiency
ich infestation over?
Our Bettas like getting sucked into our filter for some reason
well our whole tank got ich
oh my god
Jesus fuck
Our Bettas got ich but they survived
clear filter tube
broke its back on the way up
That's horrifying
burned image n my brain
Oh god
... besides the snail
still traumatised about when one got sucked up the water filter
Somehow were doing well
my tank failed miserably
you know ur stuff
oh nice
we got fish first, bottom feeders / algae eaters like a month in or something
We actually did! There was a lot of algae
so theres time for algae to grow
i heard you gotta stagger the introduction
lol
Our snail was our only death
oh interesting
But I think they like live plants
they repdroduce too
Yeaaah we had one
worked for me
theyll scrub it clean
you gotta get snails
ew
lol e
Also the decorations were nasty with algey that wouldnt come off
true

She also is a little smelly
ancient
Geriatric
She is what we call

Sasha

Girl before any cat
No this is actually the matron

nice
hahah ncie
im playing sea of theiffs
hahahahahaha
maybe save it for like a year from now
thats true
There needs to be secondary action
Because I can't just shout
While shouting here's Johnny
Which would definitely include me jumping directly on him
Because obviously I would put my own spin on it
Absolutely but I think he would be mad
I just want to remotely have the ability to spook him
Can you wake him up at some point by screaming “here’s Jonny” or something some day random on my behalf
Hahah oh no
im gonna kill him in his sleep
i didnt read that part
Hahaha what
This cat is great
It's better
is not kenya
that

Nice
here's a picture of kenya eating my power cord

lmao
so you have to force quit it
there's no way to close the game
I like how you can't quit the game before you join the servers
thank the lord
the servers are still down
We can't even procrastinate if we wanted to
Fuck
and lol is that evena  question
because yarr harr
i think honestly a headset is the way to go for gaming
Also are you doing homework or anything right now
you gotta buy a mic
That sucks man
exactly
so it doesn't pick up the instruments
yeah its kinda designed not to pick up things far away
I guess that kind of microphone is meant to be close
I guess yours has to be close to you eh?
my neck got really sore
Hahaha'
bc i was always leaning in to be heard
The standing mic hurt my neck in another way
ALSO
how do they do it
like they don't even weigh anything
Haha i'm glad i'm not alone
same!
they put strain on my neck for some reason
but the inside ear things suck
in ear headphones hurt my ears after a while
over ear ones arent a problem
over hear hurts my head after a while
and a standing mic
yeah that's another reason I like using speakers
earbuds hurt my ears
https://tenor.com/view/owo-cute-uwu-tongue-out-gif-14796606
uWu
"Oh, my head just *happend* to land in your hand. Its not like i *wanted* to be pet or anything..."
Or push her head into your hand
She will just walk up and lay on your hand
yes exactly shon
Haha she comes to me when Brianna isn't here
She wants atention, but unlike a dog who will nudge you and bark, she is very passive agressive as she is a cat. So she just gets in your way
youd think shed know by now she gets more success from brianna
lol
she is the most attention hungry cat that I have ever met
she wants atention

yes, it is late now
it was supposed to be 15 minutes
sounds like you had fun
yeah tho, good adventures in pirate life simulator
yes, excellent plan
Yes, just boarding them with the harpoon and DEMANDING they are peaceful or we take everything
Its like.. going into a gas station and robbing them of thumb tacks
"YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO COMPLY PEACEFULY"
*harpoon shot*
"LET US COME ABORD OR WE WILL TAKE EVERYTHING"
"LET US TAKE YOUR CANNONBALLS AND WOOD, YOU KEEP LOOT"
AND DANCE AND SING FOR THEM
😮
"WE MEAN YOU NO HARM"
just like im at the front yelling
raided a ship ONLY for their stuff
what if we all just
a way to get cannonballs
Something I thought of
great game great content
im literally still fucking laughing
nailed it
yeaH
"hur hur huuur"
Just
lol
gross low frequency laughing
the random noises coming from his mic tho
bc i kept losing him then he would pop out of another set of bushes chasing us with his sword
it was actually mildly spooky
friday the 13th but a big dumb pirate in underwear
like jason from that horror movie
and he hid in the bushes and swung at us whenever we walked by him
i think he only had the underwear on
poor lad
we were trying to get 50 fruit from the island for a quest
lol
complete neanderthal
bald
naked shirtless beast man
put him out of his missery
it was made much more funny by the fact taht thsi guy was a HUGE shirtless beast of a character
then the MLG guy hopped in the water and point blank put him down
and put or the fire
while he tried to bail it out
beautiful
and it danced
and set his ship on fire together and played music as we watched it sink
i patted his parrot
then we met super super MLG guys
and came back with full r****d stregnth if you know what i mean witha  vengeance
he sailed a NEW ship all the way back
THEN
we killed him
poor lad
and then he came back and tgried to kill us
then I sailed his ship away with him on it and jumped off
we TRIED to teach him
lol
and took his money lmao
so we just sold it for him 😦
he wouldnt sell his stuff
he wouldnt listen
tried so hard to help him
play
we just encountered a dude who didnt know how to plau
everytime i play this game the funniest shit happens
also you can buy ship parts with blue coins too
and 30k on me
noice
i have 160 blue coins
so I can get 2 ship parts
I have 10k on me
so thats 90k
thats awesome
I have 90 blue coins
oh nice
but I can afford like crazy cannons and shit for ships already it turns out
lol
to increase rep
also you can buy "letters of recommendation" from guilds
for 20 blue coins you can buy 10k gold
for blue coimns
he sells GOLD
sells so much useful stuff
(stitcher jim)
also dirty dan
hah
id go hunter if i didnt suck at fishing lol
gotta get that bling
purple and gold is my style
ohh nice
level 20 is gem encrusted shovel
youd love the pure gold compass and shovel
and better titles equals better vanity
You can equip the title too
Gold Swabbie!
Im on level 4 and its 400 for next one
my next is 500 I think/
started 100
it gets higher each level
like 600 gold per level
a pittance
ohhh yeah
it costs gold to do that
Yea but you have to pay gold to the gold horder to get better quests
better the quest better the payoff
better the title, better the quest
You buy quests
You cant buy rep
I have a 20 karat gold shovel now
Im 20 with them
I did know that
Oh wait you mean buying the rep
I have the third tier gold hoarder title
SO since I am already level 16 gold hoarder rep
but the higher the title, the better the payoff
thats gud to know
I see
for a pittance
or any other guidl quests
greater titles lets you unlock purchasable gold hoarder questys
Yes
the best part
ALSO
youd love it
The gold hoarder guild is allll l golden stuff
nice
greater titles lets you unlock guild vanit (golden shovel etc)
nifty
which unlocks titles in your vanity chest
ohh
your reputation with people lets you join their guild
oh?
that we didnt know about
thats important

She's super not a lap cat
Kenya actually hates cuddling :(

pls snipe
There's nothing to snipe!
pls snipe
Does she like cuddles

At least, maybe longer
its been that way for like 6 months
IMgur has sound now btw
yass
Also yesss
Hahaha
happend to open an imgur gif and it had sound. Confused me.
did it? Well as long as you get sound it works out 😛 and yea its like... half a month ago I noticed they started doing that?
Had no idea Imgur supported that
It opened as a video on discord mobile
Imgur has gifs with sound. Basicly looping videos but in .Gif format.
If you click it and open in new tab you should be able to turn on sound on the bottom right? when you hover over image
On Imgur
How does it have sound
Think you gotta open it in a new tab
Make sure you enable sound

Numbers in programming are nearly entirely based on hacks haha
I had an entire course on it
After a certain level of decimals deep, it breaks due to floating point precision
lol

oh
ohy
<@331154975457673228> RUINED IT AT **22**!! Next number is **1**. You can't count two numbers in a row.
1 with 41 0s
those numbers in the brackets are 1x10^41
it does very lorge math
((100000000000000000000/0.000000000000000000001)/(100000000000000000000/0.000000000000000000001))+21
21
i may be able to exceed whatever amount of bits of processing it can handle
it does lorge math
((1/0.000000000000000000001)/(1/0.000000000000000000001))+19
19
but someone needs to type 19
I want to try something
sin(0.1)*3
so 17%4 = 1
it gives the remainder of a division
modulo
it doesnt know what that is either
so it can do odd numbers but rounds
% is usually incomplete division
so it can do basic aldriba
that would have counted as wrong if it knew what pi was
π
it cant do that either
which means it multiplies the number by every number lower than it
! is usually factorial
ah i see
18
it doesnt like exponents
or exponents
did bot die
4^2+2
i dont think it reads spaces
(4^2) + 2
4^2 = 16
in other words exponent
normally ^ works as (to the power of)
otherwise discord removes the *
√16+14
which means you can ONLY multiply 1 thing
only *
because I know X does not work for multiply
no letters
only basic math
i think it cant read words
it wont do exponents or roots though
sqrt(16)+14
yep
that would have not wokred
otherwise
it does math out brakets, not just left to right
epic
so it does brakets first
Brb le epic shower time
so that was 17
Nice
oh nice
as well
AHH
Oh yes
put negative numbers in brackets
-1+(6*(4-1))
wait i did not close a broken
Weird
hum
-1+(6*(4-1)
You almost killed us
Findlay you monster
😢
Shon wait
sorry shon

I work tomorrow but I get off by 5
Alrighty. Maybe see you around then; hopefully tomorrow or another day is gud
But no d&d
I'm going to work on some homework, but if I get mosst of what I need done early then I'd probably still be down for a round
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565663569132257283/603786629936840734/Cube_Wizard.gif
So, no dnd or zombies today then?
yes
so yes im ready
Shon is god
tomorrow

Not sure it’s worth coming all the way out if Matt doesn’t show, and Brianna has late class, and nick has homework
Dang haven’t heard from Matt still
Ok. I can swing by then. Whenever fin is done Ill walk with him
sooo ill be there around 630
im in class until 530

Bad news, matt has gone radio silent
I have finished ***the shower*** and I am ready whenever everyone else is
Yes I did
nick said we must play 1 round of zombois

there will be a poll
and
we will maybe have dnd
es

It is ok
sorry shon for when he logs in
my bad
Just realised were in D&d
And oh true
Yeah definitely, they sell so many loot boxes now they'd make their money back anyway lol
kinda like those subscriptions were you get a certain assortment of movies each month / week
i feel like even if it wasnt, itd be a good busines idea
yeah pretty sweet
And it's for charity
Yeah true
i guess theres nothing to lose bc they are only availbale for a month
For so cheap
Let alone the new one
Like COD never goes on sale
Idk how they get such good deals
wow if i had a nice computer id totall sign up
I think they release a game every week or something
This month has more games being announced too
Haha
and haha yeah
other than FTL
Also cod is $79.99 normally anyway
Same
hahah its honestly not bad because i usually get bored of a game after a month anyways
But the amount of games I'll get is worth it
$100 cad
I actually drunkenly signed up for 6 months haha
ohhh its monthly now
It's a deal for their monthly subscription so you have to spend $12 for one month of it :/
is there a minimum you can pay for it
Yeah man humble bundle came in clutch
thats a sweet deal
Plus spyro and crash bandicooy
I got it for $12 too
Yeah I'm really enjoying it
it actually looks pretty fun
https://tenor.com/view/zombies-guns-death-kill-cod-gif-5388433
The new cod sounds pretty cool
but yeah if none of those times are ideal its no worries, can just keep making polls each until we are confident something works! If its forced it isnt fun anyways
oh you tick it twice
i actually have no clue how to do the if i need to checkmark though lol

but yeah f you guys want, you can check out the poll, theres even a "if i need to" option for days you arent so sure youre passionate about playing on lol
It looks exactly like him
not sure why that emoji reminds me of sawyer
Ok that sounds good to me!
otherwise, we can make polls each week to see if anything can be squeezed in
No it's fine to do it like I don't mind
okay so if you dont want to do the campaign until january thats fine! We dont want to get in the way of your education, should only be something for fun, 
 and good times with no bad sides
Because it's a solid couple hours every session
Thing is the amount of time goes from being an escape to then making it difficult for me at least to get work done
Which I love as an escape! But its for sure not for everyone
When you have very little free time that's a lot
Yeah my assignment due dates are all over the place
It's just a very large chunk of time where your stuck only doing one thing
Thats fair! Im sure there would be times for me too, like if it were to fall before a midterm or whatever that id have to call it
But until I graduate my schedule won't really be consistent
Im definitely not bored of the campaign
anyways, if you guys are bored of the campaign, or dont think its possible to have a decent consistency and just want to do sporadic game night things instead thats fine, pardon if im being presumptious. Just want to have expectations straight is all!

i have never wanted our sweet goblin friend to die
I'm going to kill your character very soon
Haha
https://tenor.com/view/im-kidding-joking-kidding-its-ajoke-joke-gif-15215908
We can do D&D but you guys have to play a round of split screen zombies with me
I'm w8ing
Do it
Honestly yall threaten to kill my character once a week
Shit is busy
So we can do D& D
Haha yeah no I have work to do but nothing due tonight
https://tenor.com/view/cat-watching-you-gif-8126276
Y'all we both work and have school
Oh tonight
Haha I left it running by mistake
just if i find out u played cod zombies all night im coming for you in your sleep!
no pressure if marks would suffer, obvi important
I'd probably be ok for today
same minus 20 hours of work, plus masters application
I don't want my character to be killed off, I'm just in my last semester with a ton of projects and 20 hours a week of work

Yes also dunno why I posted this in <#577624643330899989>
layers

Hahaha
133%
There's nothing to snipe!
pls snipe
lmao
With loss
It’s actually expanding it by around a third
Yes
With loss
Hahaha
Compression rate of 100.9999999999%
yeah lol
But not nessecarily saying it in a short way lol
I very much do
I do
It’s sorta compression because it can say anything on the keyboard using less character types
Do you thirst for pizza
🅱epsi and 🅱izza
for
200% excited
It could be made into compression
I am like
Or punctuation
Man
But
Yeah
Like it doesn’t preserve stuff like case
If I were to replace aaaaaaaa with a10 it would be compression
Bc you also lose information
Actually nvm
It works similarly at the very least haha
That this is technically compression?
Maybe
I think

https://tenor.com/view/gandalf-dwarves-the-hobbit-adventure-campaign-gif-12075827
however when the 15 min buffer strategy doesnt work, i get fucking irate
you need an extra 15 mins buffer time
busses like the 5,6,7,11,12,14,88
gps*
rule of thumb is if its not a main line / express bus, you need to plan for an extra 20 mins no matter what, then just wait for nearest ps bus
yay public transpo
This is ridiculous
I know :/
Imagine if I had to work or something
This is why it's so fucking busy
the bus has been super shitty from algonquin
yeaaah
The bus is so fucking late Jesus
And need to make up 20 hours a week somehow
Ok
I got to work fairly late
might be more like 6
https://tenor.com/view/dnd-spongebob-gif-9627520
yes that is the plan
We are doing DnD at 5:00 today right? 5:ish
Yes
dnd tn
Yes
save her from wally world
Save Brianna*
kk!
Also going to get Brianna brb
Yeah true
so 8 can determine the swing
but a lot of bills come down to 5 votes
yeah hah
Liberals are going for 110 right now lol
and to stop certain bills
its enough to make a fuss in the house of commons
Ish
theres 8 ridings where they have a genuine shot
That's enough to have some push
yeah
and yeah affordable housing
Eh?
That's 8 seats e
Haha that's awesome
which is 8x more than they have ever won in  an election lol
There's ghetto like houses beside mansions
greens could get up to 8 ridings at current poll
It's a really odd area
It's a mix of rich and poor
gross
Maybe 25 liberals
ffuuuk
There's like 50 on baseline alone
lmao
havent seen a con sign yet at all lamo
only seen 1 liberal sign even though its Catherine McKenna's riding
I've only seen libs and cons so far
Oh crap really
and its so far like 2/3 green, 1/3 orange
That's awesome
I have yet to see a single blue sign
Ottawa Centre
guess what though
yeah i noticed that
So many blue sogns
Nepean is weirdly conservative and it makes me sad
she says it happens like 5 times a shift
I wish greens would have a better chance
yeah same
oops didnt mean to quote that
I didn't think anyone would respond like that
"After her shpeal about environment, and why the other choices are iffy etc"
Haha that's rewarding
yeah, a lot of people were like "you know what! yeah, youre totally right, thanks for the call!"
And oh damn really?
I haven't heard anyone say they were voting anyone else
Shes legit converted some people which surprises me
I've overheard so many people saying they were voting green
Lmao
and he was like "yeaaaah, i know who im voting for thanks"
Hahaha
She once called a guy who was like the candidates best friend or something
Haha
Hahah ill have to ask her when she gets home
I bet she has some good stories
From calling people
90% of the time people just dont pick up
Oh well that's good!
What's her best storu
out of like 2000 calls so far
And less disruptive
Annie has only ever had 1 person say they were in bed though
Yeah but texts are easier to ignore
True
and theyll be like "sure"
human you can be like "please take me off your list"
You aren't..... Awoken from slumber
text isnt human though
At least with a text....
registered voter list
I mean..
It's no better than the cons cold textes
they all do that
I like the greens but fuck them being allowed to do that
from 10am - 9pm
every single voter in the Saanich riding
I'd be mad
They'd be so mad
oh no
Oooof
Yes cold call at 9pm
Id never wanna do call center
"HOW DI DYOU GET THIS NUMBER"
Does Annie cold call peoppe
"why are you calling me!"
Yeahhhh
Hahaha
a lot of angry people
call centres you get...
at coffee shops you get lots of hipsters
Well it draws a certain type of people
There are better piles of shit
at staples you just deal with old folk who dont know how to use printers
Walmart is
Retail can be better
some places are far better than others
Home depot was great
Honestly loblAws was better
I actually will tho I will tell the next asshole that talks to me like that to absolutely get the fuck out
heehh
Cervix
its universal
leaave customer cervix
If anyone ever does that again and doesn't run away next time
I don't care what Walmart tells me
It's just like, I won't take it
entitled
people think they can treat customer service people like trash when they are mad
i agree though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RTpSntNngw
I'll choke you with my vest
And I will literally end your life
There is not a god damn thing about me wearing the ugly fucking vest I have to wear that means you get to treat me like dirt
And I was ready for blood
That was the most disrespectful a customer has ever been
Because I have never been disrespected like that here
jez. and yes true
I'm not built for customer service because I will fucking kill a man
I did
I looked for him
I really almost chased him
That helped
And then I was pissed and said I don't give a shit what he wants I'm not doing it. Loudly
And walked away
Yelled it at me
And I said oh I don't really know anything about the computers and he said I don't care just tell someone
And he came up to the front and I was just getting some stuff that had to get thrown out and he said hey your computers are not showing the correct price and clearly no one cares
most people get through it by not having souls
yu stil have a soul
ur also not built for customer service
He yelled at me because the price on a tag did not come up on our scanner
He was so fucking rude to me
I just want it to happen
again
im excited for the day you never have to work at walmart aain
I really, really wanted to
I did not
I nearly left the store to find him to tell him to fuck himself then just quit right then and there
I really really mean it
call centre is not glamorous either but hey 18 bucks
I mean it
Today
Killed a man
I nearly
I did my time
booo
boo walmart
hah yeah
I get milk crates turned upside down
I don't get nice chairs
because wallmart is not the palce to be
Why do u guys all get higher than minimum wage and get to have a nice chair
:[
$18 / hour though which is nice
call centre for the green party
And Christ where does she work
Honestly I stay up til 1 or 2
rip in peace to both of you
midnight
8:30am - 12
shes still at work
8am to 11 on
Annie too

any day wirjs for me
Thursdays for d&d or hangout Thursday
What was all this ruckus
<@!296572507241054209>
and you might work
but brianna might not have it off
beanz
Starrealms
so could playboard games some nights
matt and i could goth get there by 5pm thursday
thursday works for me
since he doesnt have that lab
Matt voted thursday
But
ok noice
I need to figure out what's going on with phirelight
Ok lemme see
Id say wednesday or thursday
If we want to keep the quality of nights going that we currently have
Or other days
Could do the other things on weekends
yep
But it still works for D&D
Unfortunately not
so cant really fuck around with smash or board games
I could only get there 6:30 earliest
So since its a 20 min walk and then 40 min bus ride
I'm always free after 5pm not including bus times
so you're always free after 5:30 not including bus times
And thanks harsh made it for me lol

3 onlines
Yeah haha
online
OH
also how is that a full course load
wow cool schedule nick
￼
oh damn i cut off the times on mine

also thursdays matt doesnt have that lab
it could be but itd be late
Oh shit so is it still Mondays then?


Matts is first mine is second
Holy shit is that ur schedule


Schedules
@everyone
https://i.imgur.com/c1AVDwU.jpg
so much pizza
lol yes
we should get 2 large and 6 mediums
infinite pizza deal
oooooh
if you get all 3 for 5, you save like 40$
order 1 large, get up to 3 mediums for for 5$ each
Pizza hut has an amazing deal
Yes
if its still going
for monday
also nick
haha
it started out dnd
so sorry shon
D&D has anthropology and breastfeeding
i was confused about this dnd topic
oh shit we are in wrong chat
Anthropology course that said males should breastfeed
ye
That shouldn't be allowed
Yeah, that's just fucked
Environmental Impact Assessmrnt course taught by a gardener
climate change course taught be a denier
ive had some horrible courses
i no longer just trust a course because its in a post secondary institution
Im becomming more woke to nonsense being taught
I don't think it'll be nonsense
im worried they are going to teach you nonsense
he took it?
or what
like if its preaching deep ecology, green anarchy
He said it was easy though
That's what Exequiel said
Probably bullshit
whether its going to be really easy, really cool, or complete bullshit
im really curious about your living green clas
Thought it was probably
news
fake nes
nah
Isn't there a law that you legally have to be connected to the grid
no electricity sorry
so
you cant buy copper though
I wish
make a windmill
grow your own food
make a clay house with your bare hands
go out in the woods
theres a solution
so
yeah also everything you use or every service you buy consumes it
Yeah, unfortunately it's nearly impossible to boycott them as they own everything
some of those 100 companies would go bankrupt
if every single person stopped buying products that used fossil fuels to make, or stopped using products that consume fossil fuels
in all reality you can
lmao
checkmate
boom
"its a bullshit mantra that indiiduals can make a significant difference"
lol
but you should use that line in class loo
Yeah that too
but planes do too
lol they are floating cities
Cruise boats put out an insane amount of CO2
Yeah. I think the biggest or at least one of the biggest is a cruise line
Just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to a new report.
Because the world is retarded right now
But we don't
What individuals can do is vote for them
Yeah, we need more regulations
when corporations produce something like 75% of emissions
its kind of a bullshit mantra that individuals can make a significnat difference in the fight against climate change and environmental degredation
Easy
I'm hoping it's that esy
class dismissed
Yeah hahaha
'do not litter'
living green lmao
oh jeez
Living green, history of design, and Programming Research Project
I have three online classes
Onlines
looks like just 2
how do you have so few classes lol?
alright sweet
I'm good for whatever's best for everyone else
Well those days work for me too so
but i could make it for like 5pm if we do wednesayd or thursdays
i think monday
Ah damn well I guess we can finalize something on Monday
has class until 8pm
and i think matt maybe on one of them i forget which
but yeah monday and tuesday would def be 7pm arrival for me
Yeah!
wow so you can do any day!
Haha
i read it as 7pm
ohhh
5pm
That second blue is my last class on monday
I got rid of a vlass

I can!
We'd have to start right away
but you cant do monday!
i could make it for like 7ish or slightly before
It's a possibility though
True
Hmm
i couldnt make it for 6
well
Black and red show like bussing time
So you can also do Monday then eh?

it displeases me that this gif was left the most recent message for so long
https://tenor.com/view/rickandmorty-morty-dance-gif-9083188
Yay!!;
But only 4 left before i grajitate!
I hate all the options
Im confused about what courses to tak
I will by monday hopefully
Not yet
Does everyone have their schedules and stuff
sounds good
But definitely should discuss for sure
I'm fine this Monday!
We should be good for this Monday though eh? Maybe we can discuss it then
So @everyone , considering our time sceduals have changed a little, I think we need to figure out what days we can and cannot do DnD, because Mondays might be a bad day now. Im not sure if you will still be gone Fin, but lets figure out what we know going forward. If you dont know your scedual, let me know when you might, so we can figure it out.
For me, I am avalible basicly any time EXCEPT on saturday from 12-5pm (Im good after that) and sunday from 5-10pm (basicly not good that day).
How is everyone else looking?
So, Considering Fin can come as he is busy paying to lose internet, should we just have a hang-out session monday? Play some smash and other games?
lol yes
<@!257986741896609802>

layered puzzle
so the image is right
oh no
oh
look what it did
9 dashes
yea thats like
___ ___ ___
uh
___
it will become
like if you put three _
discord turns _ into BOLD
Thats the proper number for hangman
There

😮
hold on
uh
let me see if I can like
did not wokr right on discord
The thing I sent
Uh
Also
and ITS THE BETTER OF THE TWO
we'll pay sean off to tell us the answer
Thanks for bass boosted
What if we win a million dollars for solving the fact that the jeopardy theme song is in Morse code
Omg I googled that and it hasn’t been thought of
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALHsRJ1TZ4Y
ill play some jeopardy trap
see if i get anywhere
ill try and do some tn
the code is help me kill me help me kill me
What if we decode it
I feel like the jeopardy song is already in Morse code
i cant even LISTEN to the beep boops
i really dont think i could do this for a living
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN1yxadBBEU
New found respect for Morse code telegraph operators
sounds boppin
now that
oh shit
*beeps in tune to jeopardy*
but i agree
then myself
i'd literally probably kill everyone in the room
Lmfao
BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP plus jeopardy music
For a start
I think May He Go Ill is correct
this sounds like torture
Layered puzzle. Jeopardy music will just play for next week until it’s figured out
Lol no
what do u think
smash the telescope
lets
i have an idea
Like the answer of this solves whatever goes in the blanks
I think it could be a layered puzzle too
stress
HHHHHH
That’s less than 1/4 of the blips btw
Ah lol
ive kinda just been using what you wrote and like using every possible letter til it looks like it might make sense hahaha
Good to go through the starting hit over and over as you write what you think it sounds like and then slowly move on
No stress or rush
Haha well maybe you can try again when feeling up to it and with quieter method
because . . .  the beeps are very loud in my headphones rn
i might have to leave this to you and nick and possibly matt
They become clear with some practise listening to the same bit over and over
Spaces are important gotta pay attention to the pauses
i cant find very many vowels happening when i use other letters :c
The thing in top box

For word length like hangman
oh
Like he sent spaces
oh wait sean sent characters
may he go seems like it might make sense
Although May he go ill doesn’t align with the characters shon sent
hes actually the main boss
bleptlep
Bleebletip
bliptlip is gonna kill him
Bleptlep
bliptlip
That’s as far as I got for now lol
May he go ill bebo
too fast
the sounds dont really sound like anything but beep beep beep to me
fffucccckkkk yeah i dont think i can really do anything with this either
There’s tons left
That’s just the very start
may he go ill
(I made some changes)
May he go ill
May he
Best I got for tonight

ill play with it a bit
I will reassess this tomorrow
tell us she needs her egg backkkkk orrrrr
a chicken trying to like
is a dragon or like
is
......
My egg
MIY5EGG
Gibberish
are the lines the pauses 😮


Oh hah
i mean my letters are definitely not hahaha
We need those
My dots are but I haven’t found the pauses
that is correct
i dont think
gamhwn

I guess that’s important
Well I haven’t found where the pauses are sorrry
which is g
just line line dot
i dont see anything thats line line dot doot
Well letters
Yep
thats how many words are there?
Line line dot dot
This is the length of the words

or line line dot dot
is it line line dot
Shit that doesn’t paste right
____: ___ ___ ____ __ _____ _______. ___ ___ ____ __ _________ _______. ___ ____ ____ ______, ______ ____ __ _____ _____ ____.

The Sightstone
A small golden telescope, allowing one to see great distances. Small scratches and bits of rust indicate wear to the item, but otherwise it functions as a perfectly normal telescope.
The Truth: This telescope shows the true reality of this world, stripping away all hidden aspects of this world. Everything observed through this telescope is correct, showing reality as it should be. The world seen through one's naked eye is false, but the telescope shows the truth. This item is a gift from the divine, given to man to aid them in times of need. When one is in doubt, look through the telescope to uncover the truth; if you do not do this, you will see only a lie. Great is this item, is it not? For it is made in the image of such greatness, allowing one to see the world as Tͯͤ̓ḧ̈́̃ę̄̿y̎͊͛ ̎̏̓ see. Now child, listen closely to me; hear my voice, as distant as it may be;
This is but the only feature of this telescope; this is The Truth.
A Lie: This telescope shows the false reality of this world, obscuring all real aspects of this world. Everything observed through this telescope is incorrect, showing reality as it shouldn't be. The world seen through one’s naked eye is true, but the telescope shows only lies. This item is a curse from the forsaken, given to man to mislead them in times of peril. When one seeks doubt, look through the telescope to uncover a lie; if you do not do this, you will see only the truth. Terrible is this item, is it not? For it is made in the image of such terror, allowing one to see the world as Tͯͤ̓ḧ̈́̃ę̄̿y̎͊͛ ̎̏̓ see. Now child, listen closely to me; hear my voice, as distant as it may be;
This is but the only feature of this telescope; others are A Lie.

An interesting idea could be to have parties in the same world but chronologically, like imagine we are just here 10 years after another party or vice versa. That way they could stroll across the lighthouse and see the wrecked stairs and massive shitheap in front of the door and wonder what happened there

Oh fuck yeag
I can bring fog machine to night
tru
Wrong chats m8
Also whoops in DnD chat
I know it suggested cleaning some stuff up for me someitmes
Does mac os suggest deleting temp files or anything
Haha Jesus yeah probably
probably related to the fact that the OS takes up 75% of my space
idk why but I dont have battlenet or hearthstone on my laptop
yeah
It's not bad but it's better to use up the 10gb first
Haha
But it's still a tiny bit compressed
16 pixels
It can compress the images at nearly lossless
Well
10KB images?
I've nearly filled my google photo drive up lmao
what do you mean by compressed?
I will use that too
10gb not compressed, unlimited compressed
thats great
Yeah! It's still automatic too
Oh I had no idea
Yep
it does?
Google photos works with ios
I have all my google photos from when i had a nexus
Oh wait what do you mean by that
exactly
No
but not with apple photos eh?
It's what I use to back things ip
Google photos can do auto backup and you get 10gb of free storagw
Im out and I previously lost all of my photos and I dont want that to happen again
Should I get icloud storage?
Oh trueee
Fog machine would be so immersive for the foggy harbour if we got that direction lol
thanks !!
Yeah that looks awesome

layout of the page lead smoothly from one drawing to the other
to make the uuuuhhhh

Fuck, hopefully I'll be off that day
I'm only free Wednesday
Tuesday to Friday
Me: Tuesday - Friday probably
Shon: Tuesday - Friday
@everyone WHAT DAYS ARE YOU FREE NEXT WEEK FOR  DND
and its not just inhaling it, the essential oils deposit on dust and stuff around your house and when cats groom and lick themselves they can lick up the oils
no i dont haha but my sister sent that
Also you have your Mac at work?
Luckily Kenya doesn't inhale i
Oh shit

should be googleable for the specific one you use
depends on what you put in them
depending on the flavour/ oil being used
apparently diffusers can be pretty toxic
oh damn so she said they have been asked about it before, and also about vaping and essential oils and diffusers
Im asking my sister who works in the vet office
'they' as in this paper im reading
its got more chemicals in it
huh they are saying vaping is worse than fog machines
Yeah
inhaling is bad too
likely if she ate them then yeah
Minimum 32mg of nicotine in those
So nic salts would be super fatal to cats
Ah damn
And nicotine should be of concern because, for cats, it's very toxic. Generally, cats can handle 5 mg of nicotine per pound of body weight before it reaches toxic levels. And an e-cigarette cartridge can contain anywhere from 6 mg to 24 mg of nicotine
its super super toxic to cats
its the nicotine
but its not the glycol
oh so apparently vaping is terrible for cats
well its the same compound in vape juice yeah
And it's probably worse to vape occasionally
Ok cool
they are just saying actors who do that all the time get like lung and eye irritation after years of plays
but in reality thats not even that bad
like if its floor to ceiling
because it can make too much in a confined space which is bad for people and animals alike
basically they are saying turn it on, then turn it off
Perfect! We can get it spooky up in our apartment
it also can depend on the compound being used for the fog so we should just double check that to be sure its safe
like dont make it solid floor to ceiling
they say just dont overdo it, but thats for both people and pets
nice
and sometimes the cats even like to play in it
So I googled it and people say smoke/fog machines are okay with humans and cats alike
Awesome to hear! I'm still free!
Good news @everyone ! I now have confermation on weather I will be avalible or unavalible this weekend: Im good! So we can have our session as per normal, unless my notice has caused you to scedual something else during that day. However as a forward, I now know I will be unavalible during the weekend of Friday 28th - Monday 1st of next month. A long ways away but now you know I wont be here during that time.
Sounds good!
but I will probobly be back monday but I wanted to give a heads up anyway
Our session should probobly be fine, but there is a tinny possibility I will be busy (fathers day, going home)
Oh no, that's alright Shon we can probably work out another day
Yes, this comming monday.
Okay
For monday you mean?
Hey @everyone , I might be busy this coming weekend, might not. If that is the case I will not be avalible for sessions for this weekend. I will let you know closer to the weekend if I am suddunly avalible, but otherwise assume I will be unavalible.
I agree
excellent choices
<@!257986741896609802> FOR U i have chosen:
The World
The World represents a feeling of wholeness and completion. A project for example has come full circle and you revel in the sense of accomplishment., everything has come together.  It represents beautiful beginnings and sacred contracts, as well as infinite possibilities.
And for Gwyndolyn I have come to the conclusion that this lad is:
The Fool
Despite its negative sounding name the fool in its positives represents innocence, freedom and originality. It means new beginnings and often means putting an end to something in your own life. It CAN indicate foolishness but more optimistically it stands for pure intentions and freedom from constraints in everyday life. Important decisions are coming your way and the answer is: yes
for <@428365437923753992> Im thinking because your race is of celestial/excellent blood decent I have chosen: 
Temperance
I chose this LITERALLY because its an angel, but its meanings are relatively applicable. Temperance represents remaining calm even in high stress situations. You should not ignore reality but you should not resign yourself to it. Temperance symbolises channeling divine energy, perfect harmony, and the belief that the impossible is and can always be made possible
For Glith I chose: 
The Hanged Man
which represents negative or unpleasant life experiences for the self such as sadness or illness. In its positives it symbolises following a higher calling in life and self improvement
<@!136253782131474432> you were alot harder to do just because your character is cHAOTIC AS FUCK but i settled on:
The Wheel of Fortune
which in its positives means to expand and move in the direction of your greatest desires. it symbolises luck and that time is always moving forward and life always changes. You make the most of blissful moments and opportunities when they are within reach
<@!331154975457673228> You were really easy to pick for mostly for aesthetic reasons but it still works pretty nicely, you are:
The Magician
The magician in its positive traits symbolises skill and and to use your talents and resources to succeed, the message is to tap your full potential rather than to hold back. It also can symbolise a transformation
just for funnsies im doin tarot cards of all our characters and i picked some cards that i felt matched the characters best but feel free to ask for different ones ;O
its also home to a lot of undead usualy.
Yea, shadowfell is not a fun time
Over time, exposure to the Plane of Shadow altered living things, increasing various traits and abilities but also some vulnerabilities.[22] Emotions and the ability to experience them seemed to fade over time for those imbued with shadowstuff.[23]
all things looked as if the color had leeched out, leaving nothing but black and white, which in the dimness were more like "dark black" and "light black". A light source only illuminated half the distance it normally would, flames and fires put out less heat,[10][14] and spells that dealt with light or fire were less predictable and prone to failure, whereas shadow spells were enhanced
A visitor could never feel warm, would often hear or sense the presence of things that weren't there, and could never shake the feeling of being watched. It was a constantly unsettling place.[14]
lol
Another tool of illusionists was the shadow well spell, which could turn a creature's shadow into a temporary gateway into the Shadowfell. If successful, the victim was sucked into the Shadowfell through his or her shadow and spent a few moments in a pocket realm (a very tiny demiplane attached to the Shadowfell) being terrorized by dark phantasms. No physical harm resulted from this spell, but mental and emotional trauma resulting in a fear response was possible.[31]
also i learned off a funny illusionist spell lol
you were bang on with a lot of the lore and relationship to lantern
Looked into it eh? Shadowfell is a... nasty little place
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell
Avrages btw are 5 + Con mod for everyone but nick, nick gets 6 + con mod.
Ok @everyone ! Here are some pages to help figure out what you gain at level 2:
Brianna: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/bard
Matt: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric
Nick: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/fighter
Findlay: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock
For reaching level 2 your HP also increases. Each of you have a 1d8 for you hit die, except nick, who has a 1d10. You can chose to either take the avrage rounded up + your con mod (statisticly the best choice) or you can chose to roll your hit die and add your con mod to the resault. If you want to roll we do that in person next sesion (so I can check).
*takes your scrolls*

We should just buy dozens of scrolls
Your welcome
thanks shon
great!
There are some spells that that Anyone to cast. I'll have those avalible at session
otherwise fizzle
ohhh yeah forgot that you should probably be able to cast the scroll lol
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:warlock
Here is a list for you that you can cast
50,000 gp for legendary
Yes hold on
50 - 100 gp for COMMON scrolls
I googled it and you are correct about the cost
Also you said you may link a list of scroll options?
Thanks
Sure I'll pass that on!
Hey <@!331154975457673228> , can you send this to Matt? Tell him he needs to pick a number of 1st level cleric spells to perpare for the day equal to his class level + his wisdom modifier (that should be 4). Every time he takes a long rest he can change his perpared spells to any of the 1st level but can only have 4 perpared per day. 
Also, make sure his Maximum HP is 8 + his consution modifire.
I know the scores are a little off (as in - where there should be 0, vice versa) and as a cleric, Wisdom should be high, not Charisma, but that can be talked about later
Ok fin, one question I can’t figure out form the pic: they picked asimar as a race, they have 3 subraceses if I recall; what one did he chose?
I will take a look later when sesion is done
Might need some edits
So far

Matt’s character sheet:
So paying attention was really hard 💀💀
I was also falling asleep near when I got him :(((
ahhhh
Not as comfortable with him as I am gwyn
Still gotta figure out how to use him tho
Nice
Yes! Glith is rogue
Whats Glith?
Is Gwyn bard?

Perfect
Ill handle equipment later, thats just something to give you some reading.
For both of you; once you chose a spell you know it forever. Its yourself. If you really one like one, when you level up you can swap it for a different spell. Otherwise, each time you level you gain more spells and spell slots (not many for a warlock)
that is for the spellcasters
Ayy
<@!296572507241054209> <@!331154975457673228>
Fin: You are a warlock. You know 2 cantrips, and you know 2 1st level spells. You have one spell slot that recovers on a short rest, allowing you to refill on the fly. You chose from this list. http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:warlock
Alight: Briana: You are a bard. You know 2 cantrips, +1 because of being a half elf, from the bard list. You also know 4 1st level spells. You have two spell slots you can use each day, that come back over a long rest; thats how you cast your fist level spells. You choose from this list. http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:bard
okkk
hahaha

american history x is fucked
Just watched American history X and it was a very good movie. I'm gunna need a <@331154975457673228> review of it now though
man I loved this movie it was so well done

Week #2: Following Sam Rockwell's stellar supporting role in last week's movie, you could see his powerful performance as lead in the 2009 movie "Moon". With very few actors, this movie allows you to connect deeply with the intricate details and development of the main character's (nearly) solitary life on a Lunar outpost. With scarcely a wasted scene, this movie subverts expectations with an unexpected twist, that is both thought-provoking and emotionally riveting.
Link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/
Song/vibe of movie: https://open.spotify.com/album/0ux9vxJhJoFKaD66UH3160

Week #1: Will start off the blog with an instant modern classic: "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri". This movie got 7 Oscar nominations, including best picture in 2017, and attracted critics and audiences alike with its unique atmosphere and powerful story-telling, injected with a healthy dose of dark comedy. With a plot showing the momentum of love and hate, and how they act like snowballs, exponentially growing as they roll downhill, this movie explores the always-shifting, blurry line between what makes people "good" or "bad". 
Link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5027774/
Favourite song from movie: https://open.spotify.com/track/0uHYplBhwLYey7f9qAmnSM

I left before he showed the CEO the photos he showed me
oh shit really
Oh my fuck he's about to show the pictures to the CEO
And it's kind of scary
I actually think my coworker is schizophrenic
Find what he's looking for
One told him something like "look on the backpages of <a cam website or something?> And he'll find his ex wife
He's been going on A LOT about these agents that are sending him information on his ex wife being a criminal or some shit
My other coworker told him to get that shit off his work computer
To confirm they're the same
He was showing this like picture of her holding her tits and comparing it to a recent photo of his ex wife trying to make out markings
He showed me and a coworker a bunch of super sexual nearly naked photos of his "possibly ex wife" that a CSIS agent apparently sent to him
Like schizophrenic level
Mind
My coworker is losing his fucking minr
and have you ever heard of adam blasl?
heY <@!331154975457673228> are the boys playing at the live on elgin mic night?
Our office used to be a bank haha
Yeah!
cool!
oh wo
And some others
It's the building of elections Canada and parks canada
30 Rue Victoria
Across from that
Place du centre
Sorrh
No
phase iv?
Yeah
My building is right across from place du portage
place du portage?
Get off the bus*
That's where I get off but nah
terrace de chaudiere?
So nearly the only lol
But yeah my office is tiny
Sorry one of the only
?
lol dont u have coworkers
It's weird being the only non government employee in a massive Gov building
I'm looking for a new one though
Yeah
That’s a shame
No :(
So it just can’t play them then
Ah I see
Yeah it's because it turns out they're 78s and my record player only does 45 and 33
Was that fixed?
Or something
Also how are your record/player doing nick? You mentioned before it was not working
Yes me too
I am an excited for tomorrow
the last one produced in 47
Yeah I have a bunch now haha
78s are from like the 20s
But heavier and thick
They're the same size as 45s actually!
The ink spot records I got are actually made of shalack and not vinyl and are 78s
CD
thats like a C
It's the original size
my dads might
It's really compact
i actually dont know
oh shit thats fucking tiny
Fin does your record player play 78s
Hahaha
lol
7/10 are the same
at the beginning
sample them

same
Last time I played sports was in like grade 6
Hahahaha
for someone who sucks at sports and doesnt watch them, i weirdly have a lot of sports dreams
and sucking at it
yeak idk why but i was playing football with these kids in my dream
but he was in my elementary school too
Oh I know him
went to RCI
short kid
riley mcnulty
and uh
also jordan bergsma was in it
yeah hah
Being an evil kid
I vaguely remember you talking about him
Hahaha
Kid named Ethan Hogan, my ex-arch nemesis
Who?
people i havent thought about for 10 years
weird
wow i dreamt about someone from elementary school last night
Original was definitely better
something liek that
yes
lol
I think like season 3? Ended in 2003 or something then season 4 aired in 2015
lol
And made it bad
But Netflix I think brought it back
Haha it's funny because it got cancelled on the season right before it got bad
pre buster hand loss is how i determine which episodes are good
And I didn't like how each episode was focused on only one character
Yeah, true
buster hand joke got old
tbh most of the last episodes were not great either
I watched one episode but it wasn't hitting
i never saw i t
Hahaha
hah no
I couldn't do the newest season
just every few episode he is like 'BEES?"
That's not just part of the newest season right?
Lmao I don't know why I can't remember that
for the entire series
he has a secrete bee business he doesnt want anyone knowing about or something
Hahahahaha
he always thinks everyone is saying bees
I don't remember that scene
Lmao
https://tenor.com/view/gobbluth-bees-beads-gif-3570652
But I certainly did not love him
I didn't hate Tobias
Except Tobias
Tbh I loved all of the characters
Bees?
hahah same
I also loved Gob
I know I loved hwr
shes my fav character from arrested development
lmao
https://media.tenor.com/images/47b5e4a2baad3b8a1ef3b8fef18258a2/tenor.gif
why do you need 6 pcs
Ignore my feet in all of these photos

Like I couldn't take it home but yeah
Mostly
Kind of
Yes
lol is that all yours

Not sure why we have that
One of them is a gaming computer

And four monitors
I currently have two desks at work setup and 6 separate computers
They will
also lol
gotta fucking pray PSPC responds to me
Just called "le pub"
There's a neat looking bar
We gotta get some french pints
the tradition can continue
ill be in  gatineau for summer though
same
Also, im missing summer after work pints
Probably the easiest
fuck i guess ill email them
all*
i feel like ive tried it a;;
Unknowns: Fin or Findlay?
first or last name first?
where the fuck is the cutoff?
are hyphens allowed?
Which is a bit long
You would be Findlay.yateslavery at CSC probably
lol
idk, sometimes hyphens arent allowed
CSC didn't even have a length limit
or fin.yates-lav
yates-lav.f maybe
so it cut it off somewhere
my name is too long
mine is dumb
It was just like nicholas.brisebois for everything
Yeah that's what they did at CSC
password
i can remember a passwork, cant remember the stupid username
just make it the damn email
its dumb to have a unique username
man
yeahhh
Just email that boss asking for hrs email
that ill never remember
some stupid abbreviation of my name
:/
like yates-lav.fi
fuck it was something stupid too
Yeah that might be even better
i could email my former bosses boss though
Oh fuck man
he retired
you only could from work computers anyways
What if you emailed your former boss?
hard no
Oh shit can you still access your work email?
that was a mistake
and theres nothing in my emails because i used my work email
i cant remember my login-in to City of Ottawa website
fuccck
I just got my phirelight one
And home Depot
I need to find my CSC t4
That's all going towards a vr headset babyyyyy
Oh man I'm going to make a lot of taxes back
and t4a from school if they gave you bursaries
but we need the t2a from the school
that means only one t4
i think i only worked one place at least
Oh boy
where we have to remember how to do our taxes
its that time of year again
guys
Yeah definitely! That'd make it easier actually
i neeeeeed zios
Yeah definitely! That'd make zios easier haha
Think we could go to your moms? My mum doesnt do well with noise, its why i could never really have people over in highschool
Also no were doing it
Oooof
Also I’ve been at Doug’s auto in renfrew since 10 lol
No worries if you can’t swing board games Thursday
Damn
I got to work at 10
And I like the work but it's a lot
I like the programming at home haha
I have a list of 6 tasks each expected to take a couple days to wrrks
Programming 12 hours a day
Also much to do at home
Sensor
Haha oh no
Exact same thing
I have so much work to do at work
Yeah exactly
Apparently it's both
Like socially it’s one thing, scientifically another
Like whether a tomato is a veggie or fruit
True
Just bad communication
Disagreement wasn’t really a disagreement
Then I went to work
I read up until the disagreement
I read it mostly hahaha
But yeah that’s essentially what the bot would say
We started with the word “gay” to see what would happen
Mine was homophobic
I am not sure if you have any questions or need to be a good time for the most important thing is that the same thing with the following ad listing has been a long time
Hahaha
Tap the middle each time, that’s what the bot output would be
That’s a markov chain
You know how it gives you three options above the keyboard
We had a discussion last night: they are legit just the mechanism used for your phone to suggest the next word
Haha really?
So markov chains alone are definitely not what we want lol
Also damn het is wild
Hahaha
Why did I divide sin by tan?
Answer: Just cos.
<@!136253782131474432> Het Shah is a: "Systems Software Intern - Autonomous Vehicles Platform at NVIDIA"
night dude
ok goodnight man
got it
oh
lol
it's like a .exe
oh it's a binary file lol
this is illegible
also don't steal my bot key
it'll probably only run on mac and linux
if you just run ./DiscordServerMessageScraper it'll generate it for you if you want to mess around
uh


cant you just set it to stop when the message ID reaches 0 or some shit
It's insane computers can deal with that
and yeah that's so much fucking data
no fix 😦
took like 10 mins on my shit desktop
thats still a million pixels, so a million operations
it was originally like 5000 x 7000
i had to crop it to 1000 x 1000 pixels for it to run
i guess it was just a super high resolution image
fuck massive
bc like the array was like fucking
IDK how photoshop n shit did it
i remember doing that tasseled cap transformation on an array (image), changing each and every pixel RGB value by a specified amount
this is actually not bad when wrking with text
sounds good haha
and see what happens
gunna go take some pills and brush my teeth
Running one last time with a desparate fix
sounds good man!
im gunna bring my computer and read about markov chains and neural networks properly
i have to take the car into the shop at 10am and have to wait aruond for ages while they work on it
tomorrow we can begin with employing the data
yeah
you need to make a proper exception
But I think this is an easy enough fix
lol
I gotta go to bed lmao
It kept repeating the last 100 messages
delete and restart
Duplication again
FUCK
oh fuck
sounds about right
weve plagued shon with this bot now
:pinkphallicobject: Alright, Zinthow is gonna be in for a treat when they check their inventory 😳
oh wow
3.5MB
no it's actually getting older messages that it didn't before

thats about double
hope its not broken
yeah, I have no idea
what changed
i wonder why
oh hell yeah
and no duplicate messages
2.9MB for <#565663569132257283>

I'm ACTUALLY getting more data this time
Also
He'll be the most left wing candidate to ever be president
I'd vote for Bernie in Canada
man it'll be a game changer if Bernie wins
oh damn he did?
thatll be really important day
Mar 3rd a bunch happen
this is only two states though...
so his votes will be redistrubted
also Andrew Yang (Yang Gang) dropped out of the race
yeah
That's awesome
trueee
oh no way!
i was reading about markov chains but got distracted by bernie winning primary in new hampshire
which is a million times faster
Having them separate lets me do this multithreaded
nice
nic
Just doing this for now
Yeah
Then if I run into that ID again I end the dump
so you planning on consolidating them or no
I keep track of the very newest message ID
just re-start?
I did it kind of messy

somehow
so did you purge duplicates
And I guess writing really quickly
Haha because it was looping quickly though all the logs
why is corsets so big
I think I fixed it
huh
Shit
OH NO IT'S DUPLICATING
This time it's downloading quite a bit more
Hey fin I think I fucked up that first dump
so much data 😄
the wait group just waits for each dump to finish before continuing (to exit the program)
all it takes to make each channel be scraped in separate threads

I fucking love golang
multithreaded dumping in process boiyzzz
i kept generating one rat and goblin every turn
i had a game like that
token vs token
thats crazy
also wtf lol
andrew yang pulled out
https://i.imgur.com/l5Dm7mO.jpg
didn't get everything though

hahah
Hahahahahaha
<@!136253782131474432> <@!331154975457673228>
that is how I feel

for humans
there got a list of all the channels to scrape data from
lol
the other would be to invoke my name with the sacred @
that was one
there are a few ways to wake me from my slumber
that is me
yes
Hahahaha
this is how i pictured shons reaction to that bot message spam

guys i fount i
its like in this style but its about like summoning some cthulu esque kid
whats that meme where you summon "kid named []" or whatever and its this pic of a green dinosaur ocming out of the woods
lmfao
being on the reciving end of that
https://i.imgur.com/3B8guBD.gif
this is what I felt
but... at least I managed to get a list of every channel
I am really sorry for that spam
you summoned Shon
hahah Shon
was that
what
oh god
Oh wow
Sorry for this spam
hahah its really funny, but you could make a bot that just annoyingly interrupts you with its own thing probably pretty easily
harder
but for it to be based on the previous message as a criteria, thats hader
i dont think it would be too hard for it to just randomly interject with some bullshit
whats hard it the call and response mechanic i think, like we said
im reading about markov chains
wow
nice
ncie
niec
And making it more reusable
Ok cleaning up my code to be less memey
yes

More data the better etc
should I edit my bot to download every message on this server?
I am hyped
the bot*
i think thats the beauty of it
oh cool!
the training figures that all out by itself
the both will essnetially use english grammar
So we can say like "shitty response, bot"
Should the bot have a voting mechanism?
I wonder how we could consider something gibberish
oh yeah! I heard that in the video
but overtraining can lead to just copying real responses
until you get a good enough model
so if its gibberish, it gets thrown out
in a recurrent neural network, bad models are punished for deviating from the norm
I have zero experience with this outside of subreddit sim and AI dungeon lol
Sure dude, if you can figure out the best path to take that'd be awesome
i honestly think this may be either a markov chain or whatever, or have aspects of a recurrent neural network (easy to use someones set up) but ill try to figure it out for certain
And we can work together on the machine learning aspects
Sounds good! I'll handle the discord related stuff
ill do sum research
sure
Ok man I'm going to do the rest of this project in python do you want to help
i think itll take over a week to be honest
you can begin again tomorrow
but basically, the model will be trained to know what patterns exist, so based on our conversation, what would be a response that would fit the previous message best
Fuck I gotta go to bed soon but I want to see this working in some form so badly
it doesnt even have to be a question
Honestly you probably know more about this than me haha
exactly
Yeah
Im not sure how that works. I'm guessing like the question seeds the model or something
make the last message the qualifier
you could do a one response thing probably though
Yeah, it's a huge feat
from what im reading, an AI dunegon style is mega hard
It's probably going to be super dumb at first haha
I have absolutely no idea unfortunately
but i think its possible to get 1 response set up well
theres no way itll be able to remember anything said like in previosu messages, like cleverbot and AI dungeon does
hahah
Just half the server is bots chatting based on their channel's data
lmfao
oh wait I get what you mean
lmao
thanks Lez
"One time I saw poop demon and didnt tell anyone"
So I can have multiple models
I can see what message is from what channel, and I can compile the data with the channel IDs included
ConfessionLez
Hahaha
PirateBigLez
But definitely a lot of work
BigLez_Kenya
Also POSSIBLE with one bot
that'd be really funny
but like theyd stay on topic
Hahaha
too much work though
itd be funny if you had a different both in each channel
wow
62234 lines
62234
... I may have to do the other channels
print how many lines it is
wow
apparently!
thats it
1.79MB

i dont remember what show it was tbh
if you have real threat trends recorded and tagged (real tagged images of sharks), you can use it as training to find the same things in new images
but thats almost the same type of application as detecting security threats
yeah
well, machine learning
AI is a really cool thing
That's super neat
to keep beaches safe in australia

But yeah man it was almost the same thing, because they trained the program to recognise real sharks successfully in the end
what show?
Also that's cool!
yay!
I think I hit the end?
oh damn
one sec my bot's spitting out blank lines
imagine the sharks are security trends now
wait sorry
oh fuck
cut-outs made to look like sharks
they trained a thing using images of fake sharks taken from drones above
oh damn really?
man i saw a super cool machine learning project on a show that was similar
It'll be fun but stressful
its totally machine learning
Yeah!
with no AI/database/machine learning expirience
thats legit a crazy cool project
For a freshly graduated student
it really fucking is lmao
thats intense man!
shit*
oh hit
Which will use that data and be able to tell whether or not there's a threat pattern or if it's a "threat" but can be ignored
can we see how much youve scraped so far
Once that's done, they want me and my friend to build a correlation engine on it
So we're moving all of our datastorage over to a faster database called elasticsearch
gotcha
But the database is too slow to do machine learning on
We have all the data stored in a massive database
although theyd need their data downloaded somehow too
yeah it's fucking challenging stuff too
oh no way
True!
I need to start doing some machine learning at work
i bet you could actually make a super popular bot for people to use too if it works
But it's actually really good practice for me
yeah
but worthh it
itll be tough
man this is going to be so much fun
yes
having it somehow set to produce answers on a quasi-random basis
thatd be great
hahah yes
I think that'd be hilarious
Also i'm just imaging my bot when it's done piping into conversations randomly
I bet you could do that really easily
Yeah
its similar but a different appraoch than creating an endless "novel" or like mimicking an entire conversation
https://hackernoon.com/automated-text-generator-using-markov-chain-de999a41e047
although like you said, generating responses to questions is a bit tougher
If he managed, i'm sure I can do something with it
And did some cool stuff
I have absolutely no experience with it but I know my first sem friend was having fun playing around with it
I think if I use tensorflow it'll be surprisingly easy
the machine learning in the baroque example was train on hours of music, output a new chunk of music that follows what trends it learned
Markov chains are a lot easier but not as good
I think i'll have to look into either markov chains or GPT-2
exactly
It's more like AIDungeon
Yeah that's true
Also i've been wanting a project to work on
because this isnt the normal system, its a prompt and response system
I won't, i'm actually very interested in this project
the machien learning will be tough
hopefully you dont lose interest
One drunken night for data gen, another drunken night for machine learning
it took a stanford dude 9 hours to do something similar
But that's where nearly everything is
oh man no
Only the general channel unfortunately
also are you just doing the general channel
this may not be a single evening drunk project unfortunately
yeah...
training usually is done overnight....
10 minutes or so
how long has it been running
christ I may have to leave this running overnight
not bad
1.9MB so far
thats handy
oh wow
it's still downloading messages
Would just print whatever error you get
```python
try:
  messages = getMessages(limit, etc)
except e as Exception:
  print(e)
```
and you should do that in Go too
You can do that in python too
Although, I guess you can
no need for trying to figure out what kind of error it is
if it's not, you just print the error and quit
If nothing went wrong, the err variable is nil (or null)
in go, functions usually return both the normal return value and an err variable
```python
try:
  messages = getMessages(limit, etc)
except e as exceptions.WeRanOutOfMessagesUDumb:
  print(e)
```
i remember dealing with it in python actually
In python you'd have to do something like

shouldnt it be easy
And I remembered I handled this already
lol
But i'm writing go
I was going to say something about not knowing what the exception type was
add a stop  condition doofus

this is literally just to gather data
But that's fine
it's probably going to crash the bot
I don't know what will happen when it hits the end
ok, running it now
this actually may take a while to get everything haha
oh baby
last week
I only left it running for around 5 seconds
how long ago was this conversation?

I DID IT
holy fuck
oh it just keeps repeating the same shit lmao
oh boy
it's running
haha
I don't know why my bot is still online but ok
But here goes
I hope I don't get rate limited by discord
I'm surprised my terminal has emoji rendering
oh actually here's an example haha
I think discord just links to an image and hides the url
Images, I don't actually know
So it'll print them
Part of unicode
Well, emojis are actually text
emojis
how does it deal with images
we have a lot of text
yeah it's just text
probably like 500MB though
i bet they will be like <1GB
I'll just try it out first
ah yeah I can probably strip new lines and stuff
Hopefully I have the disk space lmfao
if you want
clean the data in this step
yes, I'll try that
okay you need to write huge textfiles now
That's true
this way you can weed out bot messages though
So
OK
yeah, that's true
probably not OVERLY important tbh
person, timestamp
who posted, message ID etc
I do have EVERYTHING about each message
I'm only printing the content
shons messages actually worked
oh my
im gunna do mild research on the actual network part, that part is confusing as fuck

wow im excited for this
drunkness
I figured out why i'm dumb
oh my god
thats sort-of what a cursor function does
thats interesting
and we are hypercritical of faces
although i bet thats overkill
his face-building AI took 13k images to make something humn
And repeat
If I can actually get real data, I can get the very last ID of the last message in the 100 then download 100 more
training needs a metric fuck ton of data
now repeat x100,000
But for some reason, all i'm getting is numbers
I got 100 messages from one of my most recent messages in this channel
i mean you could literally have it done in probably 15 minutes downloading this dudes code
I kind of figured it out
Yeaaah
easy to just employ someone elses work
IT SHOULD BE EASY THOUGH
doing it all by yourself would suck
hahah
I'm mildly drunk and my love of Go is outweighing everything right now
once you have it you could clean the data pretty easily
youre worried you cant download the text using this guys exporter?
if you use a pre-built network
yeah, I could easily build a bot that just logs all new messages
the machine learning part isnt that big
you could technically have the bot reacting to messages with emotes
:/
it's a huge project :.
it looks pretty comprehensive actually
I'm getting hungup on the not-hard part
I'll probably end up using it
Oh I actually saw that one!~
```
DiscordChatExporter can be used to export message history from a Discord channel to a file. It works with direct messages, group messages, server channels, supports Discord's dialect of markdown and all other rich media features.```
https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter
You might be able to download all of your own messages
But they don't seem to
yeah ideally
Legally
Discord SHOULD have something like that
I know
google takeout is really easy
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo?tab=doc#Session.ChannelMessages
should be easy
like it keeps every message
its weird because discord message search is prety inclusive
thats not good enough
ooooof
And this API onlyt lets you download 100 messages at a time
oof
So I have to scrape it manually
discord has no official way of doing it
big files i bet
probably text file, timestamp, username, message
But i'm onto something
it's surprisingly difficult
shouldnt be hard
so  did you figure  out how to download discord data
I hate it so so much
haha js sucks
I FOUND SOMETHING
nvm
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo?tab=doc#Application
but it's not in THIS
https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/TextChannel?scrollTo=fetchMessages
I need this
but I despise javascript with a burning passion
The main discord API library uses javascript
UGH
Literally just generating music by pressing a button
Imagine showing this stuff to people way back in the day
this video
Very accurate
Hahaha
HERE IT IS

ahhh i'm trying to find a specific meme but I can't find it
It gets easier and easier
Lmfao

It’s all his school projects for Stanford CS courses
His*
I’ve watched like all of us machine learning stuff, it’s all so good
Hahaha that skit at the beginning though
It’s funny, and you don’t need all 20 mins of it, but parts of it are super helpful for understanding the basic ideas behind this
lmao I like this video
Nice
Haha
already got it open
I’ll see if I can find link again
Very similar project
It’s in tensorflow too
Oh right!
If you get a chance, quickly scroll through that baroque AI thing
https://github.com/NickBrisebois/BigLezChatBot
The program is a bit more than that
well
lmao
A single if statement
Have no fear, I am a fellow human just like you
who ARE you?
such chat bot
Hahaha
Wow very sophisticated

Ish
Oh nice that’ll be easy
Yeah sorry haha
But I know tensorflow is mostly python
It’s offline
I'm a MASSIVE fan of go so that's what i'm doing this part in
<@676962651103821826> hi
Haha nice
I actually am not as afraid of basic python as I used to be
I'm going to start by trying to download our entire discord history
If I’m skilled enough
Haha sure dude
I have no idea what i'm doing
Let me know if you want me to make commits
I'm winging it
yes it is!
This is a fun project
Yay nick you’ve begun!
Have no fear, I am a fellow human just like you
who ARE you?
<@!676962651103821826> who ARE you?
<@!676962651103821826> who ARE you?

Or
To work on BigLezBot
Time
at least something worked
So im using a 19yo mouse and a 17yo keyboard
ol' reliabled Mac 2003 first gen bluetooth keyboard
holy shit  guys guess which one worked
Uno the movie???
I’ve got o make one of these work:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pe76JctJ8c
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boaFVClfTXs
two different trailers
its actualy rated the number 1 comidie of 2016
Fun fact
The kid falls everytime
They keep trying to jump down a bunch of stairs
rip
Instead I'm watching some kids skateboarding in Rideau center
Its hilarious

Now fite
I guess I got put here when I was removed from the corner
what
ever since he got out of the corner of shame?
since when
wait did you guys notice that shon is in the fight club with me
what does it sense
Ive tested it a bit
I'm just doing other work rn
test it?
Tbh I think it's done for the most part
hows the sensor
lol
Obviously he want always so fucked
He used to have a wife (who was actually black) and has children
Like when you’re 50 what can you do
I think he could use it
I feel like he has gone down a crooked path. Maybe government should offer re-education/reintegration programs or something for people who go so astray
Yep
Hard to feel bad for people when they are assholes
What a thing to go on about with a new guy in the office
FIRST SHIFT
He went on a rant about Muslims being terrorists
On my first shift at phirelight
It's actually funny
I know
you cant make this stuff up
this guy is ridiculous
This guy is comically sad
He bought a slow cooker for the office
One day he spent nearly the whole shift making Chili
Some days he spends hours in the kitchen just making random food
And he gets tasks but never accomplishes them
He's supposed to be a networking guy
thats janitorial though
wait wait
Also fuck
haha every office needs someone to do the shitty jobs
Like cleaning the kitchen
But he does all the shitty jobs
noice
also the couch was wet and i was like "what is this" turnes out i was sitting in dog puke
He's the office joke almost
but still
Man I don't know
i dont really want him to lose it bc his life would be fucked
how does this guy have his current job
fuccccck
And yeah lots of stuff is changing environment related
Because his "bitch wife" told his boss a whole bunch of lies and got him kicked out
This guy worked for DND and got fired
Yeah this one is super obseleye
the field is evolving so fast
Hahaha shit
im already worried about my 2019 degree being obsolete
noooooooo
He took a photo of it and made it his wallpaper
its a wonder he wasnt laid off
NO JOKE
And no joke
In a frame
He got network management certification in the 80s and he keeps his certificate on his desk
jesus was this guy from phirelight
Because he's useless lmao
hahah how do you make double what he makes
he is gunna get broken in on
And idk, he doesn't do anything useful at work and I'm pretty sure he makes $18/hr at the very most
Oh definitely
why is he in community housing
He talks about his meth head neighbours a lot
so she used it for drugs
In community housing
This is in his current place in the byward area
After
wonder if that was before or after his marriage ffailed
depravity
This dude is in his 50s
D:
He once proudly told me he gave $40 to one of his 20 year old neighbours because they showed him their tits
At first I felt sorry for him but now I cringe at everything he does
He's a fucking mess
They're attractive enough
I'm bad at judging age
this guy needs to get his life together
Like 40s
Who didn't expect a *George*
how old are they
Yeah probably. And they just seem like very nice people
probably looking out for their jobs
Yeah they play along with him
But it's backfiring
afraid to reject him straight up
They're so nice to him
I know ...
poor cleaning ladies
gross
"yeah yeah I've heard it all before"
And he's like
bad bad not good
They said it's too cold right now to do anything wait until summer
nononon
And he was complaining that they never called
ohno
A while back apparently
He gave them his number
:/
:?
To the cleaning ladies
Walked into my depressing coworker ranting about his shitty marriage
That's a great way of putting it
your mental health will be worse when you have cancer
its like buying cigarettes and argueing "my [mental] health will be bad without them!"
in a dying business that leads to death anyways
yeah
It's like investing in a dying business
its double comittment breaking, breaking reconciliation / UNDRIP, and breaking committment on phasing out non renewables / fossil fuels
For real. And oils going out
economy will be fucked by climate change more than it would be by one less pipeline
the "our economy will die without it" argument are a sham
yeah its so shortsided anyways
Fuck the pipeline
Also I'm on the natives side
Spam calls are killing me

I'm just so happy this never happened in a retail job
Hahaha aw
told my parents when i got home and they laughed at me
and barely worked that morning
I had it at RMG
yeah...
It's horrible
I really really hope it doesn't happen again
then it was done
I had two waves with mine
half life of 4-6 hours
Fuck
caffeine reaches its peak at 45mins after consumption
Oh man
beware second waves
Hell
Only took half an hour of feel
It's getting better
I think I'm actually ok now
Immodium would definitely help too
you will be *pure*
you shall be cleansed my child
purge the juice from your body
i found that an extra strength tylenol actually helped a lot
did you bring any advil or tylenol
😦
I just need this pain to stop gdi
Yes lmao
makes you less productivity
productivity juice
when productivity backfires
Put me out of my misery please
Yeaaaah
my hands were shaking, knees weak, and i sat on the shitter for an hour
This was my third medium coffee today
and it was a mistake
Yeaaaah
drank a large really fast
Yeah I'm dying
Also lmao that's the theme

Now I've been stuck in my work bathroom for like half an hour
I drank too much coffee and it made my stomach hurt like hell

it was 100% confident i was exiting a vehicle at that timestamp

wow creepy
2014-2016
yep
okay so this is probably only from like the 2 years of owning the nexus
ive apparently never been to your house...
every inch of campus is lit up
but it definitely knows i went to uottawa lool
im not so sure it even knows where i live now..
lived*
it doesnt remember when i loved in Old Ottawa South
i must have been off the grid for like two years
yeah wow....
but my nexus 5 did
i dont think my old iphone did
i feel like its because some of my phone had location always on, and some did not
wow this is weird
hah it knows where my dentist is though
i like that its a heat map
which i have been to much more often than bogie peaks
but it doesnt seem to remember the fact that i worked in white lake for 4 months...
it knows about bogie peaks

this is very bizarre
off
i feel like its kind of
://
that doesnt seem right
um it thinks i was at Fellows highschool a lot in pembroke
😮
it remembers wayhome
also i have never been to London Ontario, at least not in the last decade as far as I remember, but it thinks i have
it doesnt remember my trips to BC

you could make a nexus 10
We could combine our nexuses to make $100
I also have a broken nexus 5
corroded to sh
but the port looks like it wouldnt even allow a charge
cant find a charger for it
probably not
no clue
does it still work?
oh no way
Just found my nexus 5
Still cool
I guess only $100 used though

These go for $400 on eBay...
Just lemme know it'd be no problem
Sounds good dude

Thanks man
Haha okay last resort I guess. I’ll let you know tomorrow if I can’t figure anything out I guess!
Portable CD player nice
for you to pick it up
man if you can get a ride to my house i'll legit tell my mum to just dump the keyboard in the mailbox or something


So I can’t use my PC this week
Rip
then connect it to your usb
solder some wires onto the main board of the keyboard
😦
Is there legit no way to set up any of these FOUR keyboards?
Hahahaha
Designed for windows 98
Cordless

wtf that's bluetooth?
You need a fucking keyboard to set these keyboards up
I can’t use any of these
What is this a fucking 1998 Bluetooth keyboard
Are you fucking kidding me
it's so loud that I hate it
it sucks because at my mum's house I have a mechanical keyboard that i'd just give you
😦
Another keyboard I can’t tucking use
I took my Logitech in to staples and was like “help” and they said nothing could be done
Oh shit I need that
you just repair it
they just made one dongle that can connect to any device
logitech figured that out though
true
But if you lose the dongle then it’s literally useless
it's way more reliable
Just having a USB dongle is 100x better imo
I hate bluetooth keyboards and mice
I have 3 Bluetooth keyboard with no way to use any of them here
Honestly they are way more trouble than they save by not having a wire
I could use a good old wired keyboard right now
Bluetooth keyboard are overrated
Lmao
no sorry haha
What really
CMD + SPACE then type bluetooth
Fuck how do I set up a Bluetooth keyboard with no dongle  when I can’t even sign in without one
Plugged in a decade old mould for it to work instantly thank goodness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzvZHK-cvqU
actually nvm 2003 does feel that long ago
lmao shon no
its almost as old as my pc
it's weird that 2003 was 17 years ago
oh man
2003
Super gummy
Hahaha
I found 3 Bluetooth keyboard and no dongles but I don’t think this one used a dongle
The keys feel really gummy right?
I actually used one for a while
lmao

It’s 17 years old
10 pounds
It weighs like 10 poiynds

Found this beast
computerless
are you
oh no
So I went searching in the basement
He didn’t
Assumed my dad would have left his
So I didn’t bring a keyboard for my pc
Sounds good
Leave immediately after
I'll get off work around 4, get home by 5ish
Oh no nick is practising his hand skills
also what time thursday are we going to the frew
awe geeze

yo better wash yourself
And i've left a few things out
I haven't done a ton of testing
Now i'm self doubting
I know
That’s awful way of asking a question
Oh no
This is an anxiety inducing email

I'm down to play after this episode of hell on wheels
Ahh
hard to find strangers online
still fun with friends
Aw its dead?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW4htDopnOU

Are you able to play in Renfrew

This was less than a year ago haha
Literally made like $25 that week
One time on my only 4 hour shift of the week, I got sent home 1.5 hours in as it was too quiet so I wasn't needed
thatd solve our problems
Shon and I need to start a bizniss
I feel like they forgot about me
i fucked up by not pressuring PSPC to hire me sooner
gotta figure something out soon
im in a bind with my employment situation rn
commit sudoku
although full time min wage is probably awful too
id be upset
thats almost worse than no job
sad
hahah nick tahs just..
Only job ive ever been happy about getting up to go to work was the IJC
My two 4 hour shift every two week days
Walmart days all day
Hardware store days
oh hahah nice
For a while we were living in Ottawa I made a little more than him
I remember when I had a job 😦
breadwinner
No!
in highschool brianna?
Programming is the field to be in
I remember when I was the one that made the money for a short period
new lawyer
Wtf really? Lmfao
thats more than a lawyer i know makes
;u;
more than two
Holy fucknuts
two min wage jobs stacked
$36...
36
$30?
Nick is making essentially two of those wages at once
I'm involved
I make 15.40 something !!!
I made $23/hour at my max
I think Annie is getting somewhere around $27/hour
That's more than I made at CSC
I make 400 rough dollars every 2 weeks :)))))
$1650 is really good too
I don't even know what I do to deserve the amount I make
Annie makes $1650 every two weeks after tax, and I made $1400 every two weeks after tax when I was at the city, $1250 when i was at IJC
For being Stinky and smelly and not owning Asia
It's obscene the money this smelly man makes
Deposited into my chequing every two weeks
thats a lot
hahah
$1961.61
https://i.imgur.com/xM1EUth.jpg
obscene
an obcense amount
thats
wait
No after
wait before tax you mean
I make $1950 after tax
in a paycheck after tax
Most I ever made was $1380...
I could get an oculus for $600
Annie makes $1650 after tax, assumed youd be th same
Oh then yeah definitely would clear me out completely
AH im thinking with tax
If no tax
I'd have $250 left lol
And
Yeah there's no way I could afford it as a random purchase lmao
thats literally every penny of two weeks of work
I'm going to save for ir
thats an entire paycheck
oh fuck
$1600...
how much does steam VR cost

i wanna play now but i dont wanna set up my desktop
also, if you dont use scouts, life will be hard
do you have a factory / automatons yet
to look after the 10 dudes that will be alive in there
i legit need to put an automaton on an infirmary i bet
until they weren't
haha
My people were happy
Watch yourself
HEY MAN
you need like several if youre gunna survive the end
hey man
damnnn
oh damn dude
bc my people were never sick, so i was like "lenny shrug"
I don't have any of those
OOH
like the one that takes cores
only one infirmiary
i have tons of hospital tents
yeah level 4 is 8x that consumption
how do you only have one that late
hahah
i have more than enough food, but i only have one infirmary
I had 900 coal and I had like "12 hours left"
Yeah I got to level 2 on the generator
but that was a fuck up
each cost 2 steam cores
I built 3 industrial hothouses lol
god damn
at this level of heating
its only 4 days worth at this temperature
for the sotrm
holy fuck
and it wont be enough
Also I stockpiled 17,000 coal
"wait why dont i have any coal anymore
yeah
haha
resource management in frostpunk *seems* like it's easy until it isn't
its pivotal
from 25 to 10 steel and 10 wood
you can get an imporatnt research that lowers the cost of houses
Oh damn nice
rn on 4th level generator, with all max insulation *houses*, and fully upgraded heaters in workplaces, people are about to die
But didn't have enough wood
I was trying to upgrade the tents but I also had to build more tents to house the new people
I was also exploring a lot and kept bringing back more people
people were mad
lol
it was getting bad
thats warm af
yeah I was down to -70C
ah jesus
to survive
you need to research every single heat research and every insultation one
you essnetially need at least 3 in order to get enough research for the storm
Way worse than my second
My current game is a mess
But I don't have anyone working them
I have two in my day 8 game
3 by day 7
jesus
3
then it was like "mission: amass 4000 food"
how many workshops did you make
The industrial hothouse upgrade?
lasted me until day like 35
built 3 hunters huts early game, and one industrial hothouse
Neither do hunting shacks
Hothouses barely produce anything
I never paid attention to food until day 30
lmao
you become a god
I don't even know how to handle food rn
eliminates them all
I fucked up on food
and the last law in the religion one
I quit the game just after getting them
lmao
but yeah the faith keepers beat the shit out of the londonoers
i didnt make a brothel either
that path
and ublic house
No I hadn't gotten that far down there
hahah i got that one too
For having a +200 population all with access to an arena
did you make a brothel
hahaha
I got an achievement actually
Haha I already had two arenas and a pub and moonshine
people fucking love the fight arena
fight arena
Oh! I got the DLC I just hadn't claimed it yet
built a pub
spammed abilities, noone homeless, all kids in child shelters
he showed up for me too
Like that freezing dying dude showing up
spammed abilities
Mine just kept raising
How?
I had the faith keepers just built
Hahah I got mine to 0
Hahaha
you can eventually get an ability on the temple (big church) to execute people
Oh yeah also my londoners count was at like 55
You can use a sermon every 2 days too
and lower dissent
the abilities raise hope
Oh yeah! I had an evening prayer
yeah same
like "nightly prayer"
But I believed having something to believe in would give my people hope
I didnt realise if you select a church you can use abiilties on it
It was a hard choice
apparently...
Its easier
Same
yes I chose religion
Religion or Order?
did you get far enough to pick an ideology?
oh holy crap
costs like +$20
i dont have it
oh sweet
I got one DLC with the humble bundle
yeah
Oooh really?
its an expansion pack
its like before the ice age
I thik so
do you have access to the last autumn
hahaha
oh damn
I noped the fuck out of that
i havent tried that oe
You have to save a MASSIVE city
I loaded the wilhelm scenario
oh interesting
I tried a different scenario too
It's hard to start a new game
oof
Hahah shit i almost did that a few times. RIght nwo its going to go down to -150 in two days so i saved and quit and havent had the courage to reload it
I backed out of it and started a new one
My day 26 game was slowly dying
jesus
-110C currently
lol I know that feeling
day 42
im too much of a pussy to finish my first campaign
i'm dying on day 8
Brianna's getting better
haha wow youre both playing frostpunk
probably
But it's possible it was working harder maybe?
I doubt it's because of sending signals to nothing
maybe signals is the wrong word
ill trust him
idk
it was a power cable that was broken
Lmao
Maybe, if I don't think about that too hard
cant you only send stuff in a closed cicrcuit
Can you even send signals to nohting?
does it?
Ah makes sense
open ended wire
essentially its not loosing electricity sending signals to nothing or somthing
no, but the dude said that replacing the flex cable increases battery life
I can not use it for ages then it'll still have half a charge
I got one and mine does the same
oooh did you get a battery replacement too?
its at 37%
also my macbook retained a charge after seeping for like 6 days
this is it
https://open.spotify.com/track/7e2wEtoPoWxqECswjtWgNt?si=yh7qxUiBQJKyCu8dXsLlXQ

like it's so bad but

Plop him somewhere else I guess
What do you do with the goose now that his home has been removed from said government building
Gotta save goose
Not laugh snicker
Migratory birds act
It makes me snicker
What a bad goose
I... Like the idea of doing finances for a goose building a nest on a government building

I like that
HAH
My favourite is the last one
About never being hired permanently at CIRNAC
Oops one of those was for my dad

Meme platform with Shon access:
I’ll most likely never really have a job with SOUL either. It’s easy to work in the environmental field, but not easy to feel like you’re important or making any differences. You’re usually just doing finance for the costs of removing a Canada goose nest from the roof of a gov building. Or doing database programming in order to store information about boreholes of what types of dirt are in the ground
I went like 8 years before I got paid to program
Ah you'll make it
I was paid like twice
Ever
Yeah, I'm most times not paid
My dad has been an artist all his life, at times paid, most times not
But it's not where my SOUL is
It has its own things I really like
Art can still be a good portion of your time in work and outside of it as well
Haha yeah I don't hate this current course
Well I guess it’s good to be driven either way!
I'm like.. driven to get a job not driven to succeed iny dreams
I'm not passionate
It's ok, it's not art tho
Ah yeah I understand. The program you are in right now seems cool too though
I just miss it 😥😥
And also hear about their successes in the field
I don't want to face everyone who knows I failed and then deal with the questions
Do it! Go to those $10 ones
Good lad!
Made it to renfrew
Curves on straights
See where her hip and stomach overlap.... Which foot...... Is weighted....... Line direction
I WANNA FEEL THE LINES OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AGAIN
But I can't.... I could go to the life drawing initiative but everyone knows me there and I don't want to face that
Make me wish I could do it again
And it's also DEPRESSING
It's awakened the passion that has been dead for a year
Also I'm thinking very violently about life drawing now
It wanted me to write a review
:)

it's so fucking expensive
wait nvm
next paycheque?
It might be late... I'm probably gonna have to skip class >>
Same
excited
I am
Awesome
Yep
sureee
Does Thursday work
Haha nah I'll drive you of course
😢
Sorry Shon you gotta walk
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hahahaha
https://tenor.com/view/no-noooo-funny-my-crush-gif-3486054
give you a ride there, then just leave you in bogie
if you give me a ride
Hell yeah
lets do it
hell yheah
thatd be awesome
yea
That could be possible
<@331154975457673228> <@257986741896609802>
What if sometime this week we went to renfrew, got zios and had board games at fins
I'm doing cbls so I'm just chillin
Have been this whole time
Also I'm at work
yes
Do he play the piano
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFxDOV6IwHk
haha
Same ones everytime because your just.. taking them off anyway
Because she would just wear a pair of sweats and a sweater and just take them off when it was time to model
I saw genine out and about in the clothes she wore when she was modeling coming from Gonq and it was weird because I know she had no like... Underwear or anything on and it's like that's weird I don't like that I know that
But one time...
Rip bot
NO
Pls nsfw
Pls gif saggy balls
Genine was very quiet
Gustavo would chat with you too which I liked
So you could get away doing a lil shadow on her crotch to preserve her modesty
The old lady did not shave
I'm remembering a lot about this man's genitals
He also shaved
But that's normal when it's soft
He had a small peen too .....
Well at him
Like I didn't like noticing that because I felt rude but im literally meant to be looking at it
It's just things you notice!!
thats funny
hahahah
And he had saggy balls
In an old man way
Genine was skinny skinny and Gustavo was barrel chested and HANDSOME
Genine
Genine?
Ganine and Gustavo
I used to have a guy and his name was Gustavo and he was my favorite
Or lean on
But usually you have something to lay on
You usually sit for those but sometimes you do stand
yeah especially long poses
Yes they do because it's H A R D
apaprently they get paid well
itd be cool to be a model
I'm actually GENUINELY very disappointed I never got to draw a fat person
And how things change depending on weight
yeah!
You learn how fat is on the body
Hahaha that's good tho
one model was a giantess apparently
I'm surprised
Oh, wow
theres only one dude in the class
but was actually beautiful in her own way according to annie
Haha mine was an old lady too
Good!
missing teetth
one was like a old lady
yes
Do they do nude?
It's hard
You need to know how to hold your weight
A very little bit
I've actually modeled before
You have to be relaxed an in a comfortable position
idk how the models hold it
but yeah she did a few where it was an hour long
Unless they use some fancy sight stick I've never heard of
Hahahaha no I imagine it's her pencil
It's difficult and you have to trust your measurements with that
so i had to imagine what she was using
she just didnt have it in her hand when she was telling me
i honestly think it was a pencil
Perspective
and she did long poses where things are different lentghs bc they are facing you, so its all short and weird looking unless you get it right
I've never heard of a sight stick tho
im just tryna remember bits she told me
And that's your measurement unit for everything
she said that
oh yeah thats right
You use the head
Head
Yep
and then like see how many units everything is apart
you hold it arms length
oh she might too
its like from proportions
I use my pencil
What's that
and she uses her sight stick thing
they went over long poses
yeah a little bit!
Sight measurement?
Has she done long poses?
hah
I can teach her the not fun wanna kill yourself stuff
Bring her over and I can teach her some stuff too
2 feet x 3 feet
Ok I figured but I wasn't sure
I'm bad with numbers
huge
Like it's big right
26 x 30 something
or the one size down from that
30 x 40 newsprint
Sketch book or full size
How large does she do her life drawing?
Bring her and tell her to bring her pad
That’s cool!
So I can stand
WHEN I do it I put whatever image I'm doing on my Tv
I like getting peripheral teaching from when she comes home and has me do it
Her and I should get together and do some life drawing
Makes sense
Yeah that’s fair
I'd love to do life drawing again but paying for a course for me would probably be a waste of money anyway since I learned most beginner stuff in college
Compared to what I make that's basically half my pay
It's like
Yeah that's the thing I don't have 200+ to drop otherwise I would
Not sure if those sessions have like organized teaching too
Not sure she’d have time to bus out to Nepean
Anyways, it’s just for fun! And when you make the big bucks you don’t really think much about $250. Annie got paid yesterday and just randomly bought a kindle, I’m jealous
Public is cheaper for suree
Maybe that’s for students, or public too?
Body and form or something
But the school handles that usually
The course is titled life drawing for beginners
YES you do
Life drawing they have to pay the models I guess
Same same when life drawing generally
Like an intro class
Fine arts class
I guess it sorta is a college class technically...
Cheaper than college
I think... It's expensive
I think it’s great
So I personally wouldn't be willing to dish 200+ dollars my SELF
You can technically learn whatever you want from YouTube, but an organized environment with experts involved can be invaluable to the experience. It’s tried and true for beginners otherwise people wouldn’t pay for it
Like easily
Live models are always better than images but a lot of the techniques they teach can be learned for free
I know what you can learn for free and what you can't
But I'm gonna be jaded I've done this for a long time
Yeah but there are ones you can do for cheaper , that's just a huge thing to pay lump sum imo
Uni courses are like $100 per class
That’s less than min wage for you to be there
9 per hour
Yeah so it's gonna be expensive, but imo , very expensive
It’s for beginners
Like you build off of previous learning
Well this is a course, not a walk in
On Fridays
10 at the door
No
10 per hour?
Yeah but gonq does it for 10
I’m happy for her, I think it’s worth it and she is learning a lot
Live models and teachers are expensive
Ii just do it at home
250 for 27 hours
Yeah, it's more expensive than I'd ever pay for
Anyways that works out to $9 per hour for the whole thing
There’s a gallery there too so whoever is at the gallery usually gives a little talk too
To new things
The guest artists give context
Oh ok good
Your never learning consistently
The main one stays
OOF that's not good tho
They are at qonq too
They have different artists come in each lecture
They are legit teaching you though
That's insanely expensive
27 hours for $250 isn’t bad
At gonq it's 10 per on Fridays
Nvm
Each 3 hours long
HAHAHAHAHA
It was like $250 for 9 sessions or something
I haven't had a life drawing class in ages
Aww haha I should go too
A bunch of middle aged ladies
It’s a super casual class after work on hursdays
No points
Yep for gestures you ALWAYS draw on the side
It seems fun
Yeah we did that but we combined it with multiple things
Charcoal on its side
Yeah
The curves one you do lines
Swirls right?
OH you draw like
Teaching about volume
Oh she says it’s about mass
Beauty
That hip tho
If I did this in my class id get smacked
They teach very differently
Curvy lass she is
This was to teach curves
Annie drew this thicc naked model
because when mega simplified the torso is basically a bean
thats the torso
Haha I love it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0660Fuih7qo
The clitoris?
the bean is my favorite
u should try the bean
Yeah!
cuz theres other ways to do gestures that try to teach you to understand flow and what not and this is to teach you to like look at the pose

they're like warm up warm ups
They are fun
yeah ive done those before
Yeah exactly
like a warm-up kinda thing
And use the stick to judge proportions quickly
OOOH
Sorta like a scribbling where you’re supposed to avoid outlines
They are so hard haha, my proportions are fucked
how do they teach it
b l e s s
And she made me do 1 minute gesture drawings with charcoal like they taught her
After work
Annie is in an art class Rn at the Ottawa school of art
https://i.imgur.com/92pjPEr.jpg
Yeah it'll be neat

that sounds interesting
mario kart is getting a vancouver map
Hahaha

fin no come visit US
but board game
Come visit me if you care about my mental health
So I’m gunna be in renfrew for the next week
Lol
They know their place
They are QUIET and dont whine about how difficult life is
The people are basically void of any personality
And no no one gets banished
What
They
i lost 6 people
thats the only time i banished people from the city
people
when these guys tried to rape peopoe
i never banished anyone except once
do you banish anyone in frostpunk
stop bUGGIN me
but no i dont really like that the game is so invasive on the clock
and respect my rule
in banished they die silently
wah wah this wah wah that
the people are annoying me
PLUS
i can go fast the whole time
AND
but ive managed in that
banished is the most unforgiving mess of a game
hahaha its boring otherwise
never once touched the fast button in 40 day campaign
and pause when i need to think
i like to make my mistakes fast
worried some shit will go down while im not paying attention
im too nit picky
dont think its my style but imagin you'd all have fun
I NEVER ever play on fast mode
oh
i dont understand what you mean by that
go fast
like you can speed things up
oh the one you have been talking about
what do you mean slows down clock?
please
please
and yes
its a drag gay bar
ANYTHING happens slows down my clock
go watch some drag queens and dance it up
what is lookout
night time slows down my clock
slows down my clock
would you guys like to all go to the lookout at some point? itd be really fun to go together
like theres a message
its mostly that its like... it keeps slowing down my clock
kinda like a resource based, roguelike, strategy city builder that is very unforgiving
its very much a  hardcore strategy game
im not enjoying frost punk 😦
so far....
Damn though, I'd like to check that bar out sometime
Lmao
This is how we beat frostpunk

YOU FUCKING IDIOTS WE'LL FREEZE TO DEATH
WHEN WE HAVE NO COAL
MY PEOPLE ARE FUCKING PROTESTING
<:HapBee:510573320781955093> <:haHAHAH:469298363427192863>
BEPSI
GAMES
I AM
PIZZA
yES
You guys free for board games, pizza and pints this week
Lots of hunters
Got a beacon, almost have a consistent food source
I'm doing well this time
Mostly because I didn't make any food
I know I'm doomrd
Restarting my game
and saw a guy holding his ball up to a sander in victoria, australia
just went on snapmap for the first time in a while
lol
Hell yeah, child coal mines it os
Next up is I can enable all forms of child labour lmao
does it lead anywhere
I regret getting child labour
It probably leads somewhere somewhat decent
Yeah lmao
people like die from it
that one looks like it sucks
fuck
hahaha
people get unhappy but you get more food
Not sawdust?
such a good one
make soup law
lmfao
I thought the cookhouse was just for fancy shit
oh noooo
I thought raw food was food
haha nice
get beacon early in the research tree, and make scouts to search placex nearby, that gets you steam cores which are INVALUABLE
I spent three days without a cookhouse
Hahaha
Oh yes I noticed those
make like fuckign 3 workshops
to increase storage limits
you can make resource depots
make sure to stockpile more coal than you think you need
hahah nice!
Child labour is legalized but i'm not using it rn
I'm getting better
I have almost enough homes now, two resource posts, and a hospital
Day 40 is when shit hits the fan
I did child shelters and then used them to train kids to make healthcare faster
Every needs to play a part in our survival
It's the first law I enacted
I managed to go the whole game without introducing child labour
And lol nick
Sorry I’m not knowledgeable in the ways of influencing
Ohhhhh interesting
And that's what your paying for
Like the app I was using has its own discover page
Problem solved
There we go
well, i'll put the children to work too
But my generator is down
Gather everything
I did end up surviving the first night
Haha
They're not gathering quick enough
Research super important
Workshop for research
Then they went to sleep
Build a workshop fast
Then ran out of wood
I made them houses
Oooh
And give them houses
But make gathering stations so workers don’t get too cold
You gotta gather like everything
Yeah that’s not much
What does the APPS discover page mean
Hahaha rip nick
I think i'm about to die on the first night
I payed like a $1.99
Yeah ! So I'm probably being suggested because I'm friends with you and or use tags that you guys are liking posts with, and it just put me on the APPS discovery page
so what did that one time payment do
oh okay gotcha
certain buildings only take workers, and certain buildings only take engineers
And it's through instagram
so engineers become an important thing later
Like I know HOW to get on the discover page of instagram
what's the difference between putting workers and engineers on a coal deposit
A second party app, OR a child of a Microsoft website pretty sure it's second party tho
To pay for like me getting on the discover page I would have to pay instagram
what dat
It puts me on the APPS discover page
I couldn't tell you that one , the payment doesn't put me on the discover page of instagram
it knows you are a lit influencer
that never show up
but waht about the 1000s of other people that are friends of the band members
It's run by Facebook so it probably has a ton of data
And so it's like here maybe you know this person
And so it's suggesting me because I'm a friend of yours
5 people use it
Friends of the band like you for example
Because even tho it's a seperate account it's probably following like
It's suggesting me because I follow one of the people who's account it is
oh interesting
That might be because I just post shit with tags that you guys consistently like OR
youre 100% of the time the first post on discover
the deliverables band account
the very first post
What
you are always always always on the discover page of the deliverables
It's not a repeated payment
it lasted a very long time
I've done that once hahahaha
Rude!
trade it for GAMES
>:o
to like bump posts
no more instagram payments
!!!!
i have idea
Ive gone hungry before to have money to pay for my Patreons
I love my Patreon artists
I can talk to the artist and be like love it
It's like
That is pretty art, but my Patreon is more personal
Hahaha yes

Can you get on my comput
Nick
:O
You keep the games forever
You can just buy one month of humble bundle
I also get ..... Good ..... Content
I give them money because i like this artist
Art in it is great
Like
I think art ok
Maybe
I want frost pink tho ..... And.......
Is it a Patreon...
I have something I pay for that's 7.00
;-;
It's only $6.99 a month
;-;! I thought it was just free
https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?hmb_source=navbar&hmb_medium=product_tile&hmb_campaign=tile_index_1
You got it for free on the bundle thing :(?
Oh wait
Yes it is for all of february
Is it still free
Nick
I'll make sure to build lots of infirmiries
I built too many hothouses for food, and not enough infirmiaries
rip fin
😦
IM so invested in my city, but I know everyone will die, and im right at the end
you get 10 free games a month
Ah I see
its easy to fuck up
well, I pay for the monthly humble bundle subscription
Its pretty stressful
nice
oh wow free?
It looks like a game that's going to stress me out
im in the last few days, im scared to load up that save
But I played 10 hours in one playthrough
Oh not bad
$11
got it on sale thoughb
No
Oh wow
Did you get it on that too>?
yeah haha I noticed it was free on humble bundle monthyl
haha true
you got frost punk!
if puns are good they are not good
nick!
hahahyea
puns are bad
it was a pun fin
it was a really dumb joke
*sigh*
i see
I am aware. the storm [bad weather] passed
"the storm passed" is used often to describ something bad going away
fin
but when youre literally talking about weather
you can say the storm passed when something bad stops
whats the other meaning
cus storm passing is a shitty weather related joke
i dont get it
*ba dum tis*
you could say, the storm passed
glad it calmed down
Weather sure was wild in the 90s
90's Weather Channel: https://youtu.be/h02Z-Z3fvOo
Yea
Out of nowhere
Calling her out in a random unrelated comment
Also I love how even if this wasn't so obviously a spam post, he's basically calling stephanie fat
It says so right there
Haha
They work.

Spam posts 😦
Oh..

oh nice! You are right under findlay rn
<@!331154975457673228> I’m at the pump!

>:0
That's definitely kentya
https://tenor.com/view/cat-fight-slap-gif-7706587
She did no such thing
hahaha
She literally swat the kitten so hard it went flying like a foot
i send her virtual kiss
Don't be mean to her

With other cats
She has psychological... Problems
No! she's not trying to scare them!
as it is chemical warfare
second one i bet
i wonder if kenya poop would make great fertilizer, or kill any plant it is used to fertilize
or does she want them to be scared of her
Im pretty sure shes scared of other cats
With her claws
She would swat at me too
And she wouldn't let me touch her either
Yes
...
did she swat it
man you should have seen kenya when Britney bought her kitten over
you need like one room dedicated to like kenya poops, with a huge litter box that somehow automatically sends it down/up a poop shoot to the garbage outside
it sucks you cant even get a second cat that is less evil because kenya would maul and maim and dismember it
If you tried to come anywhere near her I wouldn't hesitate
I would
I'm going to kill all of you
thats nasty fin
But i'd hire her right now
fucking ew
https://tenor.com/view/injection-jab-gif-8917322
They just stink
Yes, it wouldn't be humane otherwise
for the metiphorical barn
Btw her poops are back to bsing solid again
you always need the physical barn
yes
speak
I'm building the barn as we speek
NO
SHE IS A GOOD CAT AND SHE IS NOT EVIL
take kenya to the back side of the barn
NO NO NO
NO
or well she did
is it time for the big needle in the sky
SHE DID NOT
I just want a cat that doesn't use chemical warfare
poor kenya and poor you guys
oh god
She just shit nuked the house again around an hour ago
I try and imagine that every day
imagine having a cat that wasnt evil like kenya
i want that kitty
hahaha

😦
ive never made it in otherwise
yeah sorry shon i shoulda told you, you usually have to get in line before it opens
Thank you mufasa
I didn't but I do now
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TewCPi92ro
yall know what day it is
its so busy
damn
We got told to come back at 11am
went at like 9:30am, they open at 10:15 apparently
And got put in a queue
we had to go before they even opened
fuck man 😦
😦
only to be told they were fully booked
walked through the blizzard and cold
So I went to the walk in clinic
i do really love that one
YOUR GONNA LOOK AT ME AND YOUR GONNA TELL ME THAT IM WRONG
GROW UP BRO
SHE CAME DOWN IN A BUBBLE

Yes haha
its like he's calling for help
it makes me laugh , hahahahaha funny poopies *funny poopies*
Like it’s a script and he is insane but if he doesn’t read it someone will kill him
He sounds too much like he is like exasperated
That one is too chaotic for me
i love it
For some reason
I hate that one
funny, funny poop
poooop lalalalalala
stinky
😋💩
uh-oh
🙂
You’re an uh oh stinky poopoo baby
but i hate it
its a good meme
i dont know how i feel about this meme
;-;
Ur a poopoo stinky baby
Oh shit this is technically a 2020 meme too
hahahaha im a huge fan of dancing to music that fits but it doesnt
I probably played it like 50 times
I ducking died seeing that to songs like Paul McCartney and Thomas the tank engine music
good shit
The cyber goth dance
YESS
YES
THIS
OH
This was my favourite meme of 2018 I think
at least
i watch it like once a day
Lots of 2020 left
cuz its definately that rn
Comes along
Keep it until something better
Counts
And haha that coins
cuz i wanna say that video of isabelle walking and saying fuck you but thats not really a meme
i dont know what counts
i dont know what mine is
hmmm
I rank that as favourite meme of 2020 so far
its just pure chaotic energy
yeah it gets to the point of lacking any kind of reference point
I love when the random and quirky gets pushed into the realm of “what the fuck how and why did you even think of that”
u know we all like to drag random humor but yall we're still THERE
It’s sO rAnDoMmmm and QUiRKY
M E T A
It’s peak
So good
Hahaha
immediately transitions
3
like looks like its gonna count down
3*
I love the e
Surrounded by this deep atmosphere of ignoring your children early in their life to have them ignore you later in life
i like the 3
its just so obscure and strange
But nothing makes me laugh more than seeing that baby man come on and sing Spanish song
ok good
I don’t think there’s anything to get
i dont get this meme and i dont know if i ever will
im gonna be honest
This is literally comedic genius, memes do not get better than this. We have reached the peak
that song slaps btw]
“3”
3
This is all I needed to cheer me up from the globglogabgalab blues
he really likes that picture
It’s both his cover photo and profile picture
“This is acceptable”
does he even know this woman ? who knows
its his cover photo too
The blur
And he is likely sneakily taking he picture with one arm, causing he blue
His mouth is like fully open as well
no escape
It looks like an attack
the speed at which he's kissing her
I love how she looks squished
i like the motion blur on that
Hahah
of his ass cheeks, alerted the books

and the cLAP
dummy thicc
That glob is dummy thick
i hate the texture on that
Almost I guess
Oh

Pls gif globglogabgalab
rip, I can't find any images for that. try something else.
Pls gif globgogabgalab
CANT EVEN FIND A GIF
rip, I can't find any images for that. try something else.
Pls gif globgobgabgalab
Or you'll never find solace
You need to fight the globgogabgalab
You created this abomination now you have to take him out
The repetitiveness of the book dance and the melody and the stupid nonsense words
This is 100% on brand to all of my fever dreams
Why did you make him
Finn what did you do
This for some reason feels like something I have created. I feel like globgobgabgalab is a demon figment of my imagination and that library is purgatory
I honestly think it's genuinely attempting to be scary and disturbing
And the dancing books are so disturbing
I actually hate the freestyle part with the flute in the background
Very good , good for the good Christian child
Good lessons
Haha
they dont want them getting ideas now
otherwise you'll become fat and lazy
and oh my god, like literally the glibgogabgilab or whatever was trying to teach kids NOT to read books
watch this
mine WOULD but it wasnt really because they were religious it was just a movie and here
grandparents may by accident
nah
i dont know if your parents were parents that put on bible movies for you or not
but it was from a bible movie
like i hate the music
its rally disturbing though
because like that would genuinely horrify me as a kid
perhaps
I have no idera
wait did you watch that as a kid
Im not joking, i get chills, its traumatizing. it brings back some deeply repressed childhood fever dream memory
the shwibble shwabble shibble shabble
i bet you there is someone fantasizing about suffocating in her folds
its mostly the song
globgabgalab actually deeply disturbs me, like actually shakes me
oh my god the rolls are so intense
NOOOO
globgabgalab
i know the plot of this girls spongebobxsquidward fan comic thing and i dont like it
my second daughter squidlizabeth
my first daughter will be named widesune miku
yeah apparently
yeah i suppose im impressed too
is that what its called
hahah
no
np
and thats why im so?????? fascinated ???? the art is good and its all. spongebob. human. conent.

which is an iNSANELY popular fetish

oh
AND on top of it all, shes lactating
ohhhh
the pink thing is whatever she's drinking to make her titty that big
oh
its the walls cracking under the pressure of her gargantuan  tittys
what is the pink thing
what is the skin coloured stuff in the air above her
why is there hair
has seemed to have found herself in a spot of bother with her titty suddenly growing very large
what are the grey things
it looks like miku who is quite THICC already,
ok so...
wtf am i looking at

show this to your professor of science tm
thats how science works
ITS COMING OUT OF HER NIPPLES AND HER BUTT
NO

i really dont like how much paw patrol fetish art there is
i think my least favorite thing i found on there was paw patrol
oh definately not
for my eyes
not sure i have enough bleach
findlay one day i need to show you the wonders of deviant art
i like this one
um

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hatsune-miku-created-minecraft

uWuUUUUwUUUUUwUUUU

ew
at LEAST a 5/10
😠
2/10
not gonna lie my love of miku is not ironic in the least
but a little iffy
its actually kinda cute
https://youtu.be/0ilyffSSz9Q
for me
sorry i cant let anime ruin that song
and ... 😦
oh finn she did a cover of buttercup by jack stauber
i feel like so many people have jacked off to that video that i can smell the semen from here

triple retard
that video
also


taking pictures of my city before it falls
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnB1l9mlI_w
what game is this? is it like you take care of little people in their cities
thats me and nick
these guys are just casually going to the bar in -100, unaware that its about to be -110 in an hour, -120 in a day, and -150 the next day

ITS ACTUALLY CALLED THE BURRITO STOP
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
your lITERALLY so close to death
stop trying to get out
like no you need to be tied inside your burrito blanket wrap
this is a very serious type of situation but for some reason thats so funny to me
if theyre confused and think theyre too hot
tie them in their wraps
oh hm i guess in some cases you gotta like
😦
im pretty sure every burrito in my colony will die
adorable
trying to not die
with their hats on
theyre little burritos
but with real people
yesss

no
because i love it
how they wrap them up
and oh my god, have you seen
but the muscles wouldnt be contracting
yeah thats right, and you gotta wrap them up
probably taht as well
encourage the blood to come back to the muscles
and heat from your hands too
more so surface-level friction heat
oh i thought it would like
get the muscles moving a little?
well tahts the friction but yeah
i guess to kinda
yeah like if a person goes unconcious they suggest you like rub them
muscle contractions warm you up
i dont know if one guarantees the other
then you gotta stay active
if you have food on hand
yeah
or they'll go into shock and die or possibly die
and you cant warm them up too quickly either
even worse they may remove even MORE amounts of their clothing
freezing to death
when they are in the alaskan mountains
i did know that
yes!
people have been known to like think they are too hot and take their coats off
you get really confused if your body temp is like 34 or less
we are EXCELLENT temperature regulators AND mega pussies
i agree with both statements
well put
both
either our bodies are EXCELLENT at regulating temperature or we're pussies
If core body temperature is lower than 28 °C, the condition is life-threatening without immediate medical attention
oh damn
35C is hypothermia
hypothermia
I bet taht would too
42C kills you
like you put it in the fridge
if you put cold blood inside you what would happen
37C*
like a medium warm coffee
blood is 38 degrees C
room temp = cold
would you be warmed up?
i think hot blood = death
and put room temperature blood inside you
so if you were freezing
maybe not
well
which i guess is fine
well it probably wouldnt be body temp but room temp
ooh,
to body temp
like after it unfroze obviously but like
i think theyd put it in warmed up
i guess too cold is better than too hot but like
its a cheating method
its like a thing runners i thiiink? used to do?
uh
people freeze their blood and put it back in
well not dead but like fucked up
good blood temperature
2 degrees and u dead
half death
what if you make it like
i mean 1 degree too hot is like
how hot are we making it
now but, how HOT are we talkin here
the blood wouldnt have time to cool down from the elements before reaching your brain
if the blood is too hot in your brain you get brain damage and die
i bet itd kill you though
would you go into shock actually
into you while you were freezing..
quadruple amputee
so if you put heated up blood
youd be a amputee x4
core
travels to your uhhhh
bc your body isnt an even temperature
well your blood like
but like the frostbite though
or i guess maybe
i doubt your blood being too cold is what kills you
you can heat yourself
if you could heat your blood
measures too effective
i mean
but what if you were freezing tho
overheat yourself
YOU'D LIKE
hot blood = bad
oH
oh
so
fever is like when youre only 1 degree too hot
your blood is already warm
i think youd die tbh
like i mean
but imagine putting HOT blood into yourself
hahahah
i mean its a game
sounds really scary
that
an extra organ but its like a heater
your blood leaves the body, gets heated, then returns
WHAT if, you heated up blood, then pumped blood into you, like a blood heater
Saturaday at 7am is the coldest
its the solution
trap you into another 9 hour play through
blankets ifn
thats how they getcha
thanks, i think im doomed
yes, good luck not freezing too
night, goodluck
best get to bed then
well
hum
itll only be -6 (-13 windchill)
if you go early enough
☹️
me
fuk
and snowing hard
fuk
itll probably be the coldest like of all winter
😦
bad timing
oh no
gotta go to doc oct tomorrow
at night or during day?
-26 tomorrow
gunna get cold irl soon
but hope you stay warm tn
feeding you blocks of soup ice
and 1% to be on life support administered by a robot
i legit think this game wants 99% of your people to die
just upgrade the heater with a blanket
levels
its gunna go to -15
the weather is -8 rn
max yellow
i am at max heating potential rn
that yellow and blue stuff
i wish
hahah
problem solved 🙂
Last thing

just give everyone a blanket
thats what you gotta do
im gunna cozy on up in muh blankets
good luck fin
well
blocks of ice
so i assume the soup freezes
its soup
yeah
you need your heater to heat better
they might not be able to get to the food/perpare it
that happens at -120, in about 24 hours
but the problem is, apparently they cant eat if the mess halls are too cold
food production stopped long ago, but i have about 6 days worth
ur fukd
but the forecast for the storm is well into the 5th day
then my supply will only last for 4 days
So coal production will stop at -110, which is going to happen in a few hours.

now my faith is shooketh
and executed those who didnt have faith
i said "nah"
they told me that, when they started rioting
These people are truly doomed
oh god oh fuck
I was like "Phew I will barely scrape by the storm, its only -120C". Scientist in weather balloon radios in "Sir, the forecast is that it will get down to -150C tomorrow"
this game is remarkably hard to beat on normal mode
need more heat
so I probably botched it by not getting enough robots to run the medical centres to keep the remaining few survivors going until the storm passes
at that level, with all technology and advances, every single living quarter is "freezing" or the lowest temperature tier, with highest risk of death. And medical centres are too cold to operate
oh no
and my eyes bulged out of my head when i saw the temperature still has to drop another 5 levels before i survive the storm
i thought i was doing so well
this game is too hard
these are nasty
there are some quality videos in this playlist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9H1CVJtpT4&list=PLqWh7RoBBEqIEKAWrGSt-h8cAab7woiz7&index=5

this scares me

why was this even made
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtGfVFj7ehs
great one
lol

Haha reminds me of this

What do you guys think of my computer case

https://i.imgur.com/TrRH3Lm.jpg
Stonks
Also Shon lmao
Look what I found on this keyboard at Canada computers

https://i.imgur.com/Ev5DwAd.jpg
Alfredo sauce and tortellini is great
it reminds me of my mums cooking
My persernol fave, although a little more expenssive, is Classico, Sausage pepers an onions. I like it because its fucking LOADED with little bits of sausage/meat, so much so it makes a thick pasta sauce
Huns is a cheap sauce that you get good bang for your buck
and pick your fave sauce, perferibly cheap as well
as its cheap
I HIGHLY recemend no name pasta
yes
gunna do a pasta grocery run today
okay thats not a bad idea! Thanks Shon
1: Rice and beans. Very veyr cheap to eat. Though I've found it to not be much more then...
2: Spegetti and canned sauce. You can get a big pakage of spegetti for like 4$, and it has ~5-8 meals in it, depending on how much you eat. Get some sauce and spread it thin, and you can live off around 1$ a day.
3: Substute the above with the local food bank. That can get you veriety food.
3ish
You basicly have 2 options

I can't believe I sat down and drank butter and I'm going to do it again

We're kind of going off recipe here
that has no scientific merit
this is like part of that bogus keeto diet thing

So Nick is making me some
I didn't get to finish it
It was HEARTY
:)

They had it it there
Why did you drink butter wtf
hahaha ew that closet kitchen

https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/692/cat.jpg
It's happening

Brianna dared me to make it at home so I'm doing it
:(
you got pink eye
I drink the dog shit
Ok cool
not enough but yes
Is it mixed with rum
Why not
I'll drink it
You've sold me sure
Hmmmm
*Dôg Shît*
Nick disowned me because I drank butter
And how much have I drank beforehand
Depends what's it called and how do they sell it
Hmm
would you drink it
if somone was selling liquid dog shit
And I drank it
Ok
And I said
Hot water with rum and spiced butter
And they said
And I said what is that
I saw they were selling it
why
oh god
With rum
I just drank butter
Fucking respond
I drank butter @everyone
@everyone
With rum
In hot water
Of butter
A coffee cup
Like I did exactly that
Drank butter
I just
Imagine your kitchen being in your closet

But I want to be above ground gdi
It feels like a downgrade to move into an apartment $400 more than our current one
Why the fuck are decent apartments so expensive
Multiple times
..
But it took my photo anyway
I stopped just a little onto the crosswalk
I didn't run it
I'm going to fight it if I can
That really sucks
I know :(
that sucks mate 😦
rip
So I'm expecting a fucking big ticket in a few weels
I didn't even get into the intersection, just barely over the line
Just almost ran a red light and of course it was had a camera that took a photo of my plate
i only JUST now realized this has been replaying
ugh i just want the doctor to call me and give me medicine
i have tremors i have nervousness
no i can just look at my results
ive been HAVING vomiting
but i guess they are working on it
i asssumed they already had
well yeah of course
but it made sense
ill probably let the doctor diagnose me haha
different things
vs Thyroid Hormone level
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone
TSH
yeah look at second column
could be a ton of things though
but mine is high

could be hypothyroidism
oh
So its not hyperthyroidism then!
yeye i looked it up when i was researching the over active thyroid thing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone
yeah you could think of it that way!
its own hormone right
gotcha!
so like
its just thyroid stimulating hormone
anyways, i obviously trust what your doc thinks
if you T3 or T4 or high those are types of things that the thyroid produses. TSH shows whether it is overstimulated or not, TRH shows if the stuff it makes are being released a lot
yeah yeah
youd see it on your blood work
or TRH
i mean yeeees?
so i bet your TSH is high
is thyroid stimulating hormone
overworking those
TSH
yeah but i assume its probably just
well the thyroid is responsible for making lots of hormones
well ok it would be over making its OWN hormone
oh no no never mind
wait
my thyroid in general
it doesnt state what hormone i think its just like
overactive thyroid
and its just like
thats what brit has
POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME
ohhh
overies or what not
no no shes got something with like
doesnt britney have like the same thing
so what hormone was high
weird
dats good
it also causes nervousness and anxiety apparently not surprised there
i dont have any poopin problems thankfully tho
and it also causes hand tremors and fatigue
weightloss is probably being counter acted by my medications that make me gain weight
i have nausea and vomiting tho hAHAHA
bald, weightloss, bowel stuff
but i dont have that
yes hairloss is a big one
milk is gross!!
bald
ew!!!!!
What are his symptoms?
Chris
my friend has hyperthyroidism and has very diff symptoms
I'm not sure actually
cant you get some from milk or something?
yeahhh
It's hard in a basement haha
gotta get some sun
And I'm low in vitamin D
Yes I think so
hyperthyroidism?
She doesn't want to
Just tell it to chill
She's working too hard
Yeah got my results back, overactive
Thyroid hormones?
ATH or whatever levels high or low?
get the rest of your blood work done?
oh no
SO by the looks of it,, I have a thyroid condition
Favorite character
Always will forever he's the best
I love sweetpea

Sweet pea

Such a good one too
Oh man yes

My friend spammed the inbox of the person. Who hired us for months before they finally replied

oh it was sweet pea but old!
:( they'll respond
ghosted
lol

no response
I sent them an email Dec 3rd
It's government they're slow
They will
yeah if they ever respond to my email
Also you have that gov job coming up
not since Summer after 1st year
You'll have to do some minimum wage work. But honestly I'm surprised you made it this far without
and if i dont get the scholarship then i am mega fucked
but that doesnt start until september if iget in
i hope so
i reached the end of the lien
Aw man no you don't relate to this guy, he's fucked. And you're going to get a master's degree man
i have $80 to last me until i get a job
idk what im doing with my life
i relate to him rn
also that poor coworker
i want those rogies too
haha

Perogies
I'm craving those pierogies
Someone pls go to targ with me
And talking about his horrible ex wife
"if you can't be happy, at least you can be drunk"
His flirting with the cleaning ladies is like
My coworker is going for most depressing man on earth
Don’t know where, don’t know when
We’ll meet again
But too much is fallin in mine
Into each life some rain must fall
Haha nice
What else would I really need?
At least the sea shanties LP I have works
I think the player is just a little broke
I spent a long time googling after I sent that message haha
I was playing around with the needle weight settings too
Ah right
The needle didn’t weight enough, so it would slip and slide on new records whose grooves weren’t as deep
I had a weight issue on my old record player but it was different
Okay nice
I'll give it a try when I'm home
It's not a single but it's a small record
I have a small glitch mob album
I doubt Itd work either, I think your motor can’t handle 45s
Try a new single
I really want to listen to some classic ink spots :(
Oh the smaller ones are 45
If I manually made the record spin fast it sounds ok
Its weird
Even at super fast it was too slow
And played with the speed dial
They are smaller but I tried both 33 and 44
Oh wait yeah that’d be slower for them hmm
So the records aren’t smaller or anything
It's high quality and old
Though I do like the one I have
It's not a huge issue, I'll look for a new player
The light ones
Wouldn’t be the belt, would be the motor
Well, new records are fine
Is essentially broken then
And can't turn the heavy records at a good enough speed
Oh
What record player are you using?
And my record player is old so the belt inside is apparently possibly worn out
The records that I want to play are old and heavy
It turns out it's more complicated
Did you have it on the wrong one
I know haha
Record players have different settings
There’s 33 rpm and 45 rpm
Haha nick
https://i.imgur.com/aGtfZRP.jpg
i have more that needs to come in tho

u guys wanna see my blood
hey
if i was a venue owner the last one would aBSOLUTELY enrage me
for no reason
this is PAINFUL to read and makes me... so angry

just awful
they were, awful
so i had to fix up the letters about the band and oh my god
<@!331154975457673228>
OH MY GOD
FINN O
It sounds normal when I spin the record quicker
And slowed down
Why might an ancient record sound like really distorted and low
<@331154975457673228> I feel like you know more about records
It sounds like fucking demons
I have the ink spots records and I can't play them with my record player
Lmao
hence its performance
the steam store runs off of a steam engine
fun fact

Real kids played with fire

It's a kids toy from way back
I'm mildly scared of it

It probably could be me too
Lmfao
Btw
That’s a compliment
Nick I feel like that could be you in an alternate dimension if you weren’t raised properly
I don't even know
The guy uh probably has a couple issues
Also what was with the bird screeching
I know lmao
The guy was so much worse than the girl
<@257986741896609802>
Actually I'm good now
Maybe around 7?
I should be good soon though!
Sorry dude my day ended up being kind of all over the place so I forgot about that

<@!296572507241054209> you did it!
Proud of you!
And good job Brianna!
oh wow thats awesome nick
Class

It hurts and I feel gross
They gave me souvenir


My grandparents are moving out of their home so they gave me all of their records


i guess just try to fill out the form honestly
idk how to prove it though
if it has anything to do with it its worth talking about
https://i.imgur.com/p6TWQDy.mp4
So should I talk to Walmart about going to the doctor? This might have nothing to do with the head bap
Yeah it'd be cool to take a law class
the laws only work if people are aware of them
Its such a good feeling to be woke to the laws and to be able to fuck over the man with our socialist laws that are designed to look out for workers rights and the little guy
i probably coulda gotten so much money out of them for them trying to get me to work on a cabin loaded with abestos
I wish I was more woke to this kinda stuff when i worked at the trailer park
because people dont know any better
Make sure you read it carefully, they sometimes try to swindle you by doing a "behind the scenes" settlement by getting you to sign their custom thing, instead of goiing through the correct chain, through the gov
Just like taxes
It's purposely complicated
My aunt is a social worker and it baffles me how much of these systems the general public doesnt know
I guess I should fill it out
The process to claim just a day's worth of pay seems to be the most complicated thing though
thats good!
Yeah they sent a thing in the mail
Expenses include missed wages, travel money to clinic, meds/painkillers
Theyll do everything in their power to make sure you get nothing out of it, which really sucks. But since its documented, if you have real expenses associated with your injury, and report it to WSIB, there really isnt much they can do to stop you from getting compensation
https://stepstojustice.ca/questions/employment-and-work/how-do-i-know-if-i-am-covered-workers-compensation-benefits
They did they did
You pay into EI for exactly that
You should be able to claim employment insurance for missed work days
Did they fill out an accident report
I hope so >> they didn't seem to care very much when I came back
Hope Walmart takes this seriously too
Yeahhhh
Oh no. I’m glad you went in
Yeah I used to be so scared of blood tests and then I sucked it up and got one and was like “wait, did it happen already???” She was talking to me and distracted me and I didn’t even notice they took it
That's happened like twice
Wake up and vomit
That sucks
Very nauseous
Or just eat more red meat
And yeah Annie has anemia, she needed to take iron pills
Very dizzy
Baddd
How does that feel btw, your head?
Ironic
Isn't that ironicn
I'm off for a blood test
Yeah haha
Oh form hitting your head?
Noo no but the like damage to the nerve in the brain
You were worried about nerve damage?
I like that
“I have not”
And she wants me to take it easy
She's wondering if I'm anemic
And she says no damage to the nerve
There all done , she wants me to get a blood test
which really sucks, so make sure you talk to your family doctor if anything needs following up
the clinic system also has no cotinuity, like they dont communicate with your family doctor
its hard to be a good doctor and have like 3000+ patients
hope you were still able to get some questions answered
she should be nice to you
that does suck though
I would be too if I spent 9 years in medical school just to work at walmart
Grouchy
Yeah she was just kinda like
HAH
thats not good
and oh no
it was "Gourmet Cuisine"
Sorry
She was mad at me seeming
The doctor I had here once wasn't very nice
I love that
that was the official name
Very good
yes  lmao
Gourmet bistro
and it was by no means Gourmet
Annie worked at "Gourmet Bistro"
Nooo
doesnt that mean the opposite
oh no
You know it's quality because it has quality in the name
Quality Medical Clinic
But it's mostly separate
Walmart takes a bit of money
Just contracted out
I think it's mostly like
There's real doctors on site apparently
It's like a clinic that's just IN Walmart
It's called quality medical
Hahahaha
walmart + social services = no more walmart at that location
They've got cotton swabs and everything
walmart + healthcare = nonsequitor
yeah i was confused
Haha last time u didn't believe it existed
oh nice
Finn I'm at the Walmart doctor's office again

He scares me

huny bgr
They had to put a thing in to turn him off
Yeahhhh
Lmao really?
The development team found that Mr. Resetti caused young female players to be scared by him to the point of crying.
This is Julian
My favorite

God the booty was fine in that game
GT ASS
Grand theft animal strip show
>:(
Lmao
Grand Theft Animal Strip Club
The most controversial part of the game was resetti
I'm pretty sure it was banned in some countries
Ah, memories
I remember that scene
But animal Crossing is named as such because it's *crossing" the line
https://tenor.com/view/animal-crossing-chanbanhi-so-no-head-phone-smash-gif-15178588
Maybe you played a different animal game
There aren't even MISSIONS
Brianna you must have missed those side missions
Oh my god
I know what I'm talking about
i googled it
i beleive him
You could not own a strip club
Lmao
I'm screaming Nick shut up
even roleplaying as little animal creatures
why does everything need to be about sex
fucking furries man
this displeases me
oh no
ohh
You must have missed some of the wild shit there was
Oh man no
i played it on game cube as a wee lad
You could own the town strip club and hire little whore racoons and stuff
i thought it was a kids game
Yeah man
Like you work with what you have you know
wait is it
Really? It seems like a super hypersexualized game to begin with
like ew
I kinda hate that even animal crossing is sexualized by people
<@!257986741896609802>


same energy

like i wish i could download it to my brain and keep it there forever because its just so FUNNY
this is one of those things that ill just think about
i LOVW IT
i like that walk
its animal crossing music and animal crossing words
haha
she doesnt actually say fuck you
awwww no
I dont have my headphones 😦
its above pure kitchen
i have never been
this is really really funny to me and not because of the fuck you but because of how she walks in

fratty af
I feel like the crowd at maclarens is awful too
35 hours would suck though
that'd be fucking cool
Oh maclarens

I want to get one of those pourers for my bar
basically i'd suggest apply everywhere you think you have a chance at
https://www.amazon.ca/Measured-Liquor-Bottle-Pourers-Oz/dp/B001CDQ9QS
that's kind of neat
so a double you just pour twice
oh
so when you pour it pours the same amount each time
and the bottles have limiters on them
if youre at a bar like this its literally making rum and cokes at the hardest
thats all optional
go through a short course on bartending to get your bartenders
nop
smart serve is to sell but to mix dont you need to like
its easy to get
yeah smart serve
this is literally the size of this bar
that would be nice but you need a service license don't you
Imagine working at a tiny bar
Time to work at a bar
Try retail
No
So what youre saying is i should apply somehwere where i make tips

I will most likely be free at 6
Actualy, on second thought, would tomorrow be good for you? and what time?
No prolbem man
ah damn sorry dude
Naw thats fine, need to go today. Thanks for the offer tho
I can probably tomorrow if you like

We are at his grandparents right now but I'll ask him in a bit
Oi nick, I need to do a quick grocery run, would you be avalible to lend a ride? Its cool if you cant
was holding it upside down adn couldnt see the target, but just happened to spam the entire clip and hit the target a bunch, unlocked a bunch of new guns
happened to pick it up in a way where one of my fingers would graze the trigger if i hit the button for that finger
really lucky
I actually just managed to fire the gun in the target practise mode
Hahaha
it takes like 1minute if you know what youre doing
lmao
well
thats also a mode
Also lmao really?
But what if I want to spin fidget spinners
takes like 20 mins
all you have to do is load a guna nd shoot the opponent
Hahaha
theres a mexican standoff mode
sweet
its soooo hard
let's play it tonight
lmao
yes
Is it multiplayer
I keep forgeting you gave me that
Hahaha
<@!136253782131474432> when will you play hand sim multiplayer with me

Good idea
Haha yes thank you Finn you too, and I'll probably call the vet maybe and see what they think
I hope she has a speedy diarrhea recovery
Goodnight fellow Kenya lover
You only get one
Treat your body and mind well
Awful
Bet
I bed he'd do it
Get Nick to chew your food for u
Lol
Blend everything
Food tube
Just uuuh
Get yourself some fine old chompers
But your gums recede
Dentures Finn!
You can’t get new teeth
I'm spiders George who refuses to deal with such matters
I treat my body terribly and it sucks. I only have one body. That’s why I have recurring nightmares of all my teeth falling out
Just something we gotta deal with
It’s good for it to be out in the open though
Pretty low odds
Like talking about health mine specifically is freaky
Hope so too! Doubt it at your age. But I’m sure you’d beat it if you did
This is low-key such an anxiety inducer for me
hopefully I don't have cancer hahaaA
And it’s temporary
It’s varies person to person
Wow, I think it's the immuno compromisation that's really hard on you too right?
You’d die from that in the 80s no doubt
My mom was like stage 3b
Most cancers are surprisingly curable nowadays
Have to refrain from smacking me
The doctor would like
And I was like not treating it
But like if I was diagnosed NOW
Like not forced
I mean I think I'd probably be forced to SORT OF
My mom would be dead now if she hadn’t
I feel like you gotta have a strong will for that
Gpa too
My uncle is doing it rn
She’s better now
My mom did it
3 more lifespans
But then I have to go through chemo and throw up a lot and have no hair
And you could live 60 more years tha you would have had you not gone in
But then there’s a chance to save you
U have cancer
You look fucked up your dying
I'm mostly scared if the doctor literally being like
:(
And doctors is gunna notice and it’ll be embarrassing
Mine is prolly loose from all my cannonball poops
A butt is TAUT u see
Sometimes they do and that's fine but not everyone likes things goin in their butt
Unless you gay
Generally things don't go in on most occasions
Nothing normally goes into a butt
That's ur butt
For u
Fine that's normal that's what she do
Things going in is like
Like
At least on my end
bad bad but check
Not looking forward to it
Same as butt check
Of course
INVASIVE
What's the word
But it's very uhhhh
Lol
Well u see it's a very little micro penis
Jk
HMMMM
Probably similar size to nicks micro penis
It's not even so much the awkwardness of it thatb doesn't scare me
Yes
But like
Its literally just a swab
That’s not a good strategy
Like a stick kinda thing
It's like
I think about it so hard and all the things that can go wrong on every single angle
It’s probably just getting a little cue tip swab
You put it all a bit on a pedestal
And literally nothing is obviously a lie and it's the worst possible experience ever
Lol
This is me
Hahaha.
But u see
Yeah
My mom told me it's literally nothing
But I can’t know
I heard it’s not too bad at least
No!!!!
Which hhHHHhsjahh
Yeah
I need to get paps done
Pap smear is good to have though
........
To check for prostate cancer
I’m not excited about it, but at least you ain’t a man and won’t have to get fingers up ur bum
:[
Go to a walk in clinic bdawg pls. Get a physical check up. Get the peace of mind of a clean bill of health
Then demanded in said will Nick must keep it
Put in a little thingy of like formaldehyde or whatever
If I died and then in my will demanded my pinky be like
Thatd be cool tho
Same I don't like it
Maybe Nick could have my pinky
I don’t want an operation mostly bc I don’t wanna be knocked out
I'd give her my things and Kenya
Lmao
I think truthfully the stress would kill me then she could just have whatever she wanted
You also have bone and muscle and fat layers btw
It wouldn’t
But what if that's what happened
That’s not how that works
Like you poke yourself and you feel the HOLE
It wouldn’t tho
What if you like touched it and it just sunk
It’s fine tho
Now I have an empty spot that's not what it's supposed to be
Yeah but not on other side too
Where it's supposed to be
Yeah but it's there
Heart off centre
Spleen on one side
I could maybe do it then
Your liver is on one side
This is IMPORTANT, ok.
Alcohol is fine
People are also assymetrical to begin with
Alcohol
WAAAAAAIIIIIT a minute
You wouldn’t notice a difference
Wait wait wait
Wait
Horrifying
I literally don't know how to explain it but the idea of touching my stomach area and NOT FEELING THE SAME THING ON BOTH SIDES
Gotta drink water more
One less kidney
But now I have like
Hahahaha
You’re weird to begin with
HhhhhhhhHHHH
Nah
Fills the gap
There's a part of you that is now all weird
Nah shit moves around
You have a HOLE inside you where something once was
You have another one
So
It's all gone
It's empty there now
They are all centred on the skin
But think about it
Yeah you don’t have nerves on the inside really
And a missing organ
Seriously it probably wouldn’t be bad
And
...
It’d be like having a cut
I will wake up and die instantly
Recovery wouldn’t be bad honestly
Do it
Can’t
Keep me out through recovery 2 pls
Can be simple mask too, no needle
If I could do that with a guarantee id be fine I would absolutely be like literally put me out for a month if you have to
Wake up with whole new kidney / without one
They prolly could knock u out as soon as u got to hospital
For the leading weeks up to the operation
Put me in a coma
General anaesthetic
Like.. as soon as they find out it's a match
Through any part of the process
Yeah that’s normal
At all
I mean like
Yeah don’t worry ur never conscious
Know
I don't known
Mmmmmmmm
UhhhhHhhh
I would pray I'm not a match then if I am I would ask to be knocked out so I didn't have to be conscious for ANY part of it
Would you let her give you one of hers
Like if Britney was like Brianna I am v sick and need a kidney
Give her one of my kidneys
I'd probably like
Yeah ofc
If I was alive I'd just have to murder someone with a matching heart
I mean if I was dead
Lmfao
Oh she can have that
She is now the new dictator of Russia
What if Kenya needed a heart and for some reason yours worked
Her second shot at life has caused her immense hubris
Abuse her children
Murder Jews
She could be Hitler
Cure cancer
Fall in love
I did not consent to saving her
She could live for 80 years
Without my consent
And saved a little girls life
And now they gave it away
That was my thing
But my ghost would be upset
They could just take it
I MEAN
That match
And there’s no hearts except yours
Maybe
She can have a lung
Hopefully someone who was comfortable giving away their heart donates to her cause 😔😔
All she needs is a heart
Her cat is sadly meowing looking up at the 10yo girl, wondering if she will see her again after she goes into the hospital
Maybe like liver or whatever
Those are mine
And my eyes
But I like my heart
She can have my lung
Her cat is at her side
That part is important
She is about to have her 10th birthday
No it is mine
And yours is a perfect match
MAYBE a kidney
A dying child with heart cancer
They could take a lung maybe
Who needs kidneys or a heart or a lung
It can look down and watch you breath life into a handful of other people
Is greedy and does not like the idea of someone taking my things
Who has ascended
My soul
Mine
Who’s, ur gone
It mine
There is no you anymore
I grew it
Mine
No takey my things
It be dead
But like
Do whatever the fuck you want with my body
Science can have it
Yeah I know
No..
Bc ur like dead
That terrifys me and I don't really...
I’m very cool with it
What about organ donation after death
Unless you can remove it without touching me
But however mine is mine and I won't share
I would happily do that
Yes
Ur an essence thief
'preciate it
Thanks fella
So this other person who is ok with it is gonna do it
I, however, do not consent to things being inside me removing my ESSANCE
And great! Someone gave me that blood willingly how kind and nice of them!
Rip
Because I didn't want to go to the doctor
Because otherwise I'd probably hide in a corner and bleed out
Can save ur life
Paramedic has blood bag
I would likely not be conscious during this
You’re bleeding out in a car accident
That's like SUPER valuable so it's slightly less selfish
What if you ever need blood
I'm not that one blood type
Thankfully
I would honestly probably never give blood
Getting a sliver is prolly worse
It's IN. THERE.
Barely
And theres a foreign object inside me
And someone will die without it
You can literally make it right back
Yeah but it's mine and they're taking it
I need it! And thEYRE JNSIDE OF ME TAKINF IT
You can make that back in an hour
It’s literally a juice box worth of blood
They're taking my ESSANCE
Yeah exactly
I just got myself worked up
I don't like the idea of it
It’s all psychological
It’s really not even bad though you don’t even feel it
I couldn't do that
I passed out when I tried to give blood
Ever
I have never had my blood taken
At a needle I mean
I straight up pass out if I would look at it
Or force me to sleep and I don't get enough anesthesia and I'm awake but paralyzed for the entirety of an operation
I actually didn’t even feel it last time they are really good at that if you tell them it makes you uneasy
Or make me drink gross stuff
Distraction
I just look the other way and get the nurse to talk to me
Or put me in a machine
What if they have to put a needle in me
Whoopsie!
Guess u died though oh wel
Dang !
If*
Oh well
It was only 99.9% curable is treated
Do I have a brain bleed??? Idk and ill find out when I'm dead
Massive oof
I know it's very bad
>u>
That’s a big oof
Oof*
Poor
It's why I never go to the doctor hahahaha
I liVE BY THAT
Ignorance is bliss
It's one of those things I hate thinking about
ME however wish I never heard it
Some people i definitely think could benefit from that story
Nah I don’t mean about switching Kenya specifically. I just mean to me, it’s horribly sad, but sad things  can make us stronger. It sheds a lot of light on an emotional fallacy that leads to tragedy though. It can even be transferred to many scenarios in relationships or friendships or even parenting. Doing the right thing for someone you care about may be something that doesn’t make them happy, at least in the short term, but in the long term it may be worth it and you need to take the hit now. A lot of people would have made the same mistake as that lady
She thought she was loving her cat but she was accidentally killing it and that makes me want to bury myself in a hole
Which it should absolutely NOT
And it's not even really her fault on the package it says you can use it for food
I feel bad for her because she probably blames herself
It just makes me so sad
And how easy it would have been to fix
Like I didn't learn anything I didn't already know I just got this absolutely heart breaking story
Oh haha like if your meaning about switching Kenya off wet food I'd do that for her haha, and I just feel bad
Imagine how expensive buying all those tempations would be too lol
She didn’t want to make the cat upset by starving it a bit during a switch
That's probably why she did it
The cat didn’t want to eat regular food anymore so she fed them only treats
Which is awful
It literally says in the bag you can
It’s not about the temptations. It’s about the reason she fed them to her cat
I’m talking about learning from the ladies mistake she made
I'm confused what's good? Me knowing not to feed Kenya just temptations or this lady partially scarring me
And you’d do that if you really cared for them
It’s a lesson on the fact that sometimes you have to make the beings you love sad to do what’s best for them
Now I have to live with the KNOWLEDGE of this poor lady and her poor cat
It’s bigger than that
Because.... I already knew your not supposed to feed cats just temptations
Empathy
Nor was I ever intending on them ever being my mistakea
Doesn’t matter
THESE WERE NOT MY MISTAKES
Sometimes the path for doing the right thing for the people and beings you love isn’t so clear
Painful memories are good though because you learn from mistakes
These memories will haunt me
I wish I did not meet this woman
It's just so heart breaking it's like watching a person make all the wrong decisions and it ends in tragedy and u just wanna cry
And this poor woman who didn't know any better
And I think about the poor cat and I just get so sad
I can't remember exactly but apparently they just deteriorated
in a pool of diarrhangus
She's like they died so horribly
yah
It was so sad tho ;-;
so you wouldnt make same mistake
at least she was passing on her knowledge
Like that
Like when you watch a movie that really gets to you
That almost made me cry and left me upset for like a day hahahaha
like that old woman
Bad memories with that
8[
no other source of food
should try only feeding her temptations treats
But she's been fine for a while
Only that
Plus she really likes it :( I'll feel so bad for her if we have to take her off it
no changes in diet?
ah
She hasn't had that issue at all until recently :/
wet food gave my gparents cat diarrhea so they had to revert to only dry
i wonder if its the wet food
i think maybe vet
Im actually a little worried about her though
Kenya should be considered chemical warfare
A human is incapable of nuking the house with the same level of potency she has
i think she needs to go to the vet
i did my best to was her bum
How the fuck can she smell so bad
The apartment smells so so so bad
When Kenya decided to launch another shit torpedo
Was trying to sleep

ugh kenya's acting all weird
Hahaha
lol fuck off desperate SMU
lmao

what did she eat to fuck up her bowel
and she has the audacity to beg for more food
that's probably unfortunately exactly what she does
sprinkling diarrhea litter wherever she goes
then she runs around house
digs around in box spreading litter around and getting it stuck to diarranghus covered fur
so she has exlosive diarrhea in box
how *does* she do it
how does she do it
all over the floor

it's on my desk, my chair
there's kitty litter fucking flung all over the house

did she have anything abnormal to eat
was it in her litter box this time
knew it
SHITTED AGAIN

Allow inactive problems to remain so, as in Jane knew she should report the accident but decided to let sleeping dogs lie. This injunction to avoid stirring up trouble was already a proverb in the 13th century. It alludes to waking up a fierce watchdog and has been stated in English since the late 1300s.
Kids were popping balloons repeatedly and he didn't even stir

policy implications
```
The research area that I am interested in studying for my capstone research project involves science policy as applied to impact assessment (IA). In a broad sense, IA can be understood as the identification, prediction, interpretation, and communication of environmental, social, and economic impacts of projects/activities, legislation, policies, plans, or programmes. IAs are the primary tool for avoiding, mitigating or offsetting the adverse impacts and promoting the beneficial impacts of these activities, thus fostering sustainable development. Science policy can include: using science to inform policy development across a range of fields (Science for Policy), or developing policy to decide how scientific activities should best be carried out (Policy for Science). This is especially relevant to IA, since this process includes many scientific activities that are used to present evidence-informed predictions, options, and advice to decision-makers. In the past, there have been doubts about whether science has played an adequate role in government decision-making and public policy development in Canada, including in the IA process. This problem presents an impetus for better policy for IA science. The Canadian Impact Assessment Act (IAA) came into force in 2019, setting out new legislation for federal IA. One method to address this problem in IA is to review scientific activities within the process under the new act, to ensure that they uphold desired principles of scientific rigour. Researching science policy in IA would be multifaceted, as it requires a consideration of the general principles of what makes good scientific practice across disciplines, but also requires an understanding of the ways science is applied in the IA process. This becomes even more complex and interesting under Canada’s new IAA, where these activities must be applied to an assessment of environmental, economic, and social impacts. This presents an interesting knowledge gap with direct```

I’m restarting to buzz words and hypotheticals now
Alright I guess I’m at like 75% completion
this is like pulling teeth
Research Methodology:
To approach these research questions, several sources of data can be investigated. 
First and foremost, a review of current government material on the subject would have to be carried out to see where current efforts.
Next, in order to answer #1, a literature review can be conducted to attempt to collect data associated with existing means of evaluating science in impact assessment of relevant reports. This could include a systematic review and elements of meta-analysis to see how aspects of what it means to conduct “good science” within impact assessment activities have been delineated. 
In order to approach #2,
Also I have no clue, literally 0% clue what to write for the methodology for a project I have no idea how I would undertake

Some monkey man in a cave makes a shitty version of fat momma goddess to get his rocks off
I could believe those were for jacking off lol
There are some that I've seen like that that kinda look like shit
I could see it
Ask her to protect you from bleeding out when you tear horribly and that your child doest die in the first year of life
but could be true
the jack-off material is a less popular theory
yeah
Pray to her for healthy ovaries and no death in child birth
Like fertility idols type stuff
Like there's tons of statues like that obviously not that old but are like meant for fertility
religious
yeah its probably either that or worship
Not ...... Jack off material
Like revered
Used it as an idol of some kind
I would have thought maybe they like
Oh...
they suspect that statue was literally used to jack off to
30,000BC
She could birth and feed so many offspring
*her*
Ah yes

the first beauty standard:
Tf do they have nothing your literally just looking at a child and saying yeah she's hot
But like with children it's like
Beauty pageants SOME try to include beauty being multiple things like physical as well as intelligence and talents,
across even isolated cultures
Clear skin, full lips, an unclouded sclera, feminine estrogen-dependent features, a low waist-to-hip ratio, and many other cues to female fertility are now known to be pieces of the puzzle of universal standards of female beauty. Women's evolved standards of male attractiveness are more complex.
thats literally an objective form of beauty, a genetic impetus
N-no
Nnn
you wanna put a baby in that baby
But adult beauty pageants are just as fucked
fertility index + child = wack
eyes
measuring them on factors related to beauty (behind the scenes these factors are based on fertility indices) like breasts, butt, waist, prominence of the eys
6 months even
Young as 2
BABIES
Babies
Children
kill me
In skimpy ass outfits
They make the children dance
how many fucking times do they use the word "sexy" in the show
Making them sit through PAINFUL things like plucking and doing their hair in INSANE styles
how many pedophiles do you think are in the industry
Forcing children to work hours upon hours when they're tired and need a nap is awful
your bones structure
"winning or losing" is based on factors you cant control
HAH that's the least of the issues
teaching kids to make their appearance their personality
giving kids spray tans
Which is
what a fucked show
That's child beauty pageants
todllers in tiaras is toxic
Leave her alone
No she's difference
In every way they are terrible
honeybooboo
They're terrible
Are
But beauty pageants arw
but trying to be a successful model might be
Yeah thats true enough
Models aren't bad
It's not being a model that's bad
same as films and other forms of art
if youre not in the mainstream industry you cant really make money anyways
Does more like niche stuff
Sure, im just describing it at large
Crickets friend Monaco is a model
That's the main stream industry theres tons of other ways to be a model
waist*
the plus sized or albino or disabled models are a trend, yes, but comprise a small portion of the industry that is just trying to peddle a statement "look we think anyone can be beautiful" but yet its nothing more than a statement, because beauty standards are a toxic and very part of our culture built in so deeply that its genetic, like the hip to wait ratio being an honest signal of human fertility
Just beauty pageants
Never really got into REAL modeling
And that's all she ever was
A model can look different a beauty queen has to have a.LOOK
Being a beauty queen is more that
Well yes and no
being a model isnt about having a personality, its about molding to the norms of what everyone else approves or disproves of
being a model is all about thinking more about others see you than how you see yourself
She's had so many persons
she never has
I feel like she doesn't know who she is anymore
Honestly
whatever that may be
just be your fuckign self
That's what everything she's ever done has been abou
some people are way too obsessed about image, identity, all that nonsense
Gnight
I think it's all for her appearance
Also gunna sleep night mateys
I don't think she really truely cares honestly
Now she needs a new thing to base her entire identity on
Well being a poser just discredits the movement anyways. You dont want liars to support something, you want people to bring their perspective. You want the reason supporting something to be more than just having one type of blood or another, its supposed to be about compassion, altruism
Bandon parent has an indigenous id card and he didn't make any of the kind of fuss she does
Being a white fashion model got boring
She decided she's Metis
But she's not a white fashion model she doesn't want to be that now
Im also all for people standing up against injustice, or climate change inaction, or whatever other issues need people's attention. You dont need a degree in Environmental Science or Indigenous Studies to want to be a part of a movement, that is fine. Just be honest about who you are and your values if you are to be a part of it. To me it even means more, its more salient to see a white fashion model from renfrew protest than another indigenous person
It just makes me so angry
Why would she bother!!!!
Pft she can't drive doesn't smoke doesn't do weed
golden lake maybe, to buy smokes or weed
Probably never taken part in any kinds of traditional get togethers probably could barely even tell you what any of the dances mean
Has probably never even visited a reserve
She has never experienced ANY indigenous persons problems
Because that shit is a problem , I bet she never even knew it was a problem until people started saying it was
you can support something without being it, just be honest with people
its like saying i can attest to the ukrainian famine "holodomor" bc my grandma has ukrainian blood
Lucky enough to not know someone go missing
never knew anyone who did even
never spoke the language
Its an invisible minotority if you can even call it that, shes a white fuckign fashion model
Didn't deal with the shitty treatment of people on said reserve
You never grew up on a reserve
You have never experienced what the struggle is to be aboriginal
Like cricket.
Being indigenous is not a fashion statement
She just one day woke up and was aboriginal
She is wearing like traditional clothing and shit in her photos, to like compensate for her skin not being dark enough
For real
Her Metis aboriginal shit is actually making me so angry
Dude youre like 1/16 fucking indigenous
I enjoy how much it annoys me
"My anishnabe metis side says that this issue of injustice has to stop"
It's like
I follow her but her stuff always annoys me
Far too triggered
I know
I kept getting too triggered man
Bless
I had to unfollow cricket
Fuck me
Ok
SAME
I like that picture haha
HAHH
It reminds me of cricket

its bad
its all about our differing relationships with technology or some bullshit
Can we set up a GoFundMe for this poor robot
Wtf
then she kills it

What does it mean
ONE MINUTE THE ROBOT IS IN A WHEEL CHAIR, THE NEXT ITS BOXING
I bet if she talked about it she would use the word "Juxtaposition" with regards to the scenes being in nature
Being cute
Playing
I thought her and the robot were like
Oh
WE ARE AT ODDS WITH TECHNOLOGY
She's just chilling with her robot bf

Pretty colors
"TeChNoLoGy iS WeIgHinG uS dOwN"
For aesthetic purposes
Oh I kinda like that
Me: "k, cool"

At least a lot of them do
I know they apparently hate cartoon artists tho
So I actually know very little about gallery artists
Im not that type of artist tho haha
Beating the poor artists up finn
:(((
in the leave a comment book
my new passtime is gunna be going to art galleries and tearing apart rich hobby artist's work
Like the Uhh jewel coloured one
That holographic colored one is stunning tho
I bet an average person wouldnt know any of these not black and yellow bees as bees
literally a "B movie"
thanks bee movie
I think it's just because yellow and black is iconic and easy to know that's a bee
the yellow is prollly partially pollen sust
But the yellow and black makes me think that's a bee
Which they're not
They look like wasps or hornets

But not the very thin black ones
Yeah most of these do just look like bee to me
those are all bees
If I saw a brown buzzy thing I wouldn't think bee

People think of bees they think black and yellow
idk
maybe half
That's why moreso I think
portion
Are all bees black and yellow or just a small portion
the only honey that tastes very good and has high yield though
they are basically one of 4 species that produce edible honehy
They produce honey? Are they the only ones? Also theyre just easily identifiable
and people only ever talk about honeybees because big business needs them to make money
just there are 3000+ species of bee in north america
Because the seem clumsy
We have native bombuses
I like them
That's a good one
Bombus
Genus bombus
Bumble Bee
Big fluffy flying beans
I like the ones that look like beans
I know not these bees
not just apis melliferra bs
solitary bees, rusty bumblebees
yeah native ones too i hope
Aww no I love bees
we need to think in the context of native pollinators
It sounds to me like someone trying to pretend they're woke
they are overhyped
honeybees arent even native
medium motivation
Can you say it was good motivation
not tearing them a new one or anything
HAH
"good motivations, questionable execution"
!!
i remember what i said
Oh haha
Gross
Generally I don't mind art being explained but trying too hard is like
people who have never seen a fucking bee before
like this inner city bullshit
Don't explain your art like that to people
but it was along the lines of "go to a real park"
No don't do that
I forget what I said specifically
....
and it was peddling all this shit about appreciating "bee's voices" and stuff in the binder
and the moss was just sitting on a pike of dirt on a tarp in the middle of the floor
Oh :(
like it was so obnoxious actually
It was not
Oh that sounds pretty
making bee buzzing noises
and speakers covered in wax
and it was like moss all over the floor
It was this exhibit in City of Ottawa gallery
What did you say haha
It was so fucking dumb
Haha what was it?
but everyone was complenting it and i completely shit all ovber it
Ooooooh
I've never wanted people to look at me and my art at the same time
i forgot exactly what i said
I left a shitty remark in one of their guest book things lmfao
Ive been to two recently and i hated both
Shows
I don't really like gallery sjows
with all her lists of galleries and shows she has done
Ew
and then her resume in the back
Like breast binder oh
with a novel explaining it
She legit had a binder
And it's just meant to be an Asian lady in a forest with a robot
two related things though
sorry i meant to say two things
Knowing people OR being rich, usually both
Also being popular in art is about one single thing
Maybe someone is putting too much in it
Haha
I just personally think its bad
I totally agree
It really is
Yep
Art is subjective!!!!!
and if you have to explain it then it is bad
Its been a pretty thoroughly explored subject
Le phones bad
can easily be said in one picture, and its not really that deep
message of "our relationship with technology"
Hahaha
15 pics of an asian lady with a shitty robot in nature
cracks me up
man this art show at the gallery on george st in by ward
Hahaha art of fucking weird
really gets me
fucking 'art' sometiems man
Hmm those chicken breasts
And her full feathery breasts
He never knew true love til he met tootatabon
Cant believe i just spent 17 minutes on that
then she conveniently died
Rode his ass!
and he is a small man
his life was only tough bc apparently his wife rode him for 10 years
Love is like a banana
hard as a coconut
Life was tough for a monkey
he had a bad case of GONORRHEAaH
What do you expect! He grew up rough
and he clearly lacked empathy
He had a tiny little suit
slow as a farmhand kicked in the head before maturity
and he was fuckign slow
his teeth were rotting
he was not
He was really cute little money
I really liked the monkey
Same tbh lmao but you got more out of that than mr
I honestly didnt really pay too much attention i was kinda in shock
#freemonk
No monkey with a suit like that would do it!!!
and an orangutan saw it happen, but he was racist saying noone would believe her
He was a monkey of questionable morals! But he was innocent!
his love for her had more to do with her breats than her personality
He's no such thing!
died
who was happy his first wife dide
☹️
and he is a creepy fucking dude
and she loved max
his love for tutataban was unrequited
Only had a buck knife
You can really tell it's by the same people as walking dead
Jack was a good man
Finn he didn't! I don't believe it
gets kinda meh later on
for a while at least
hell on wheels is pretty good
Poor tutataban
That was an intense film though
Hell on wheels
he definitely did it
Back to watching
hahah
You guys are going to have to excuse me I have a lot to ponder
HE DIDNT DO IT
NO!!!
Did he get arrested
No!!!!!
His fucking :O
his scream
TOOTATABAN
TOOTATABAN
Oh mY GOD
IS THST
:O
AHHHHH
entertaining, but in a very roundabout way
Oh fuck
Basically
Of true lovessss flaaaaaameee
this is the Hentai Nazi of film
It's happening
I'm dying
I'm there
and the end
im excited for you guys to see the musical part
PLEASE
And feel those breasts
FINN
But once you get your hands under those feathers
no
Finn if u get any new chickens please name one tootataban
Oh no the music
Lmao
3.4
ok ok
2.7
Rate it our of ten

I finsihed it
Advanced casseee offf gonareaaa
TOOTATABAN
I'm scared
the last 4 mins are a fucking trip
oh my god
Nooooo
oh noooooo
No
Wtf
its a musical
has a singing scene
the monkey
nick
what
Oh my god
Hahahaha
"Suffers from advanced stages of GONORHEeaH"
Hahah
i hate everything to do with the monkey
I hate this so much
"let me tell you a story"
"are you a card carrying member of the communist party"
its all like shit catchphrases
"it takes two to tango"
"you dont dance"
"I dont smoke"
jesus this pacing
Show*
Fucking art
Ahh it aired at an art suit
I like his suit
The monkey is really cute
I'm pretty sure the whole production of this took one day
And he does lol
The pacing seems like there's supposed to be a laugh track
sounds like a disabled farm hand
like
i hate the monkeys voice
"arrreee my pupils dilated"
Haha holy fuck and then there's this
he has a movie on rotten tomatoes rated 100%
David Lynch
Who accepted it
Who pitched this
It's a Netflix original
Like it's so short
neither do i
I don't understand it
its supposed to be a comedy but like
it really isnt great
its
honestly
Lmfak
and hoestly
im 6 mins in
Me and Brianna are watching it now
this david lynch guy is a hotshot though
Lmao wtf. It's a Netflix original too
the acting isnt even good
iMovie black and white effect
this looks like a home video
the audio quality for the monkeys voice is like bad
... is it worth watching? I didn't even want to invest the 17 minutes lol
this is fucking nasty
Hahaha are you watching it
wtf
it has a human mouth
oh fiction gross
is it truth or fiction
I hvw not watched it
how did that go
huh
There's a 17 minute long video on Netflix about a detective interrogating a monkey who is suspected of murder
I’ll have to watch it
Ended up going to an environemntal science seminar at clocktowwr
Mental health isssues, but not in a comedic light like fat Thor
But not in a comedic light, like dead pool
It’s a bit angsty and violent but I think it’s trying to shatter the superhero norm by adding what they all censor, gore, child murder, etc
I must recommend Watchmen movie
I’ll check it out
Part way through season 2 and I’m enjoying it just as much.
But even just season 1 is good enough oh it’s own
If you do have Netflix I can’t texemend daredevil enough. It’s also part of the “defenders” MUC, not avangwrs. There are 4 Netflix tv series all converging together by the same writgers I believe.
love it
Anyway. Enough plan talk.
lmfao
I feel like plane repo is my version of your MUC hate.
It’s just AWFUL
hahah
Also sometimes they blur the faces of the people they steal from? But sometimes they don’t??
haha yes
Plane repo is just bullshit that always follows the same stricter. Go to get get plane, it’s guarded, steal it, shit hits fan, fly away, extra unforeseen complication, it gets resolved, roll credits.
Olk island I can see the apeal Becuase even tho it’s fake it’s still a “mystery” that they discover
lol
93% of people like it! How!
So awful
Airplane Repo (that’s its name) is my most hated
That show is my second least fave
The thing is, by the time it airs it’s a year old. So if they DID discover something one season, we would hear about it in the news a year before the show shows it
real archaeology takes months and months to do something safely without destroying it
like a 20 min excavation
And for god damn YEARS they have been saying they are on the cusp of a major discovery
I fucking love how they just destroyed the shit out of whatever it was while digging it up too
It’s all heresay
in the region 50k years ago*
then me and my dad are like "what the actual fuck, indigenous people were not even in the region, and this is the east coast and they didnt even use boats on the east coast"
I did not find an episode but I did find out that peice of fucking garbage show got renewed for a second season! How! Anyway continue.
"this is clearly an indigenous structure used for ship building"
Carbon date some wood "50k years old"
they look in the rubble piles at the wood
the hole collapses and fills with water
breaking it up into a million peices
no regard for its state
dumping it everywhere
they dig the shit out of it
but anyways
Srry im bac
and find chunks of wood
They dig down like fucking 20 meters
Me and my dad: Oh okay I guess they are experts or something
"This is clearly a ship nail for ship floorboards from the 1500s"
find something that looks like a very normal railway spike (I have a few on my desk)
they are on the beach using metal detectors
starts of semi normal
me and my dad watching
so we thought oak island was a real documentary by scientists a few weekss ago
is it better or worse than ancient aliens
I’m Gunna find a video of it. You start you story
love it
It’s so bad
It’s
Whenever my dad turned it on I told him to switch it to anything else
he drank an immunity and invisbility potion
I hate it so much
So bullsht
he has immunity
UHG
It’s just
Let him film
lmao
They just ignore the camera man
And while he is being detained
wow
hahaha
Just convinetly lost it
wait sorry ill let you fininish
They get stoped by the border pottol the The guy lost the documentation for the plane
So Oak Island show, we had it on a few weeks ago when I was home from the break
Then when they get it across the border,
Love it
hhha
Gunmen running past them
Just totally ignored
lol
Meaning they have a camera man
NOT BRING SHOT AT
A camera man was still on the ground
'Reality' TV
Meaning
There is a scene of the plane taking off from the ground!
HAHHAH
BUT WAIT
Start to fly away as they are getting shot
get shot, shows over
Start up the plane
death risk
They sneak in
hahah
lol
Camera men show they have armed guards around the plane
Illegal tresspassing
They sneak into a Property
An example:
Ok so like
or like park rangers
I feel like Brianna ranting right now
Its like those shows that follow cops
Like
I fucking hate this show
Let me give you an example
Hahaha
**FAKE**
FUCKONG
SO
It’s
But here is the thing
i havent heard of that
lol
oh man
The reposes stolen planes
ok
on old discovery channel
No
Wait are you talking about the one that analysed plane crashess
Olk island does not hold a candle to it
Have you see that
But then plane repo
Treasure hunting
They legit just tear into stuff
or anything
Or history knowledge
s
None of their assumptions or methods or tool
none of this is done properly
none of them are scientists
and these guys
Like so passionate
I was so into archaeology as a kid
I was like
BECAUSE
My god
IM SO TRIGGERED
I hate it too
I HATE IT SO MUCH
So bad
I FUCKIGN HAT IT
So unbelievably fake
i HATE IT
Oh my god it’s so fake
Plane repo show
It is
The worst!
NO
Curse of olk island
The worst is
Suddenly it was no longer WW docs
Deadliest Catch is fuckign terrible
Once that went up, that was the turning point.
STORAGE WARS
The nail in the coffin
PAwn Stars lmao
That was it.
Los Angeles Restoration
Pawn stars.
I saw the first show that ruined it all
Canadian Pickers
same as history channel
I saw the decline
Utter garbage
And see it
I’m sad when I go home now
Deadliest Catch
Ice Road Truckers
WAS
😦
Was
It was a great channel.
and daily planet
I loved mythbusters
We only had it for like 1 year
Lots of WW2 knowledge.
Lucky
Ohhhh
I watched the discovery channel
For like 10 years
I grew up in a household where we never ate dinner at the dinner table, we would sit on the couch and watch 1-3 episodes of whatever series were were on, or a movie.
He is also suffered form Tramma, and you can tell he is a little off.
Thats cool
A very huge amount
Kingping in it legit feels he is the good guy, doing something evil Becuase he has to so he can rebuild the city full of crime into something beautiful.
I have seen A LOT of TV
I like that
And you want to root for em
And villains in daredevil (Fisk, aka kingping) feel very real.
Like if it doesnt literally have Paul Rudd climbing into Thanos' ass then im not sure its my kind of humur anyways
I still get bored though
Action Comedy is like okay to watch with friends I guess
Daredevil is action/mystery.
Ant man is funny, take it as an action comedy and you’ll enjoy it.
shit
like i said before HALF of MCU movies are so shut
Maybe my recommendations will help
so i likely miss some of the good ones
Well
since ive had sooooo many waste of time experiences
See, I dont really go out of my way to watch these kind of movies
Second one had me laughing for like 20 mins strait at one part.
Jesus there is more than one
Yea. The first and second, I see as action comedies.
super charismatic
great actor
Because Ive never seen it, but Paul Rudd no doubt carries it
What did you think of that
they just did some entertaining stuff using his radio to communicate with like music
🐜
Btw you never mentioned ant man
making a mediocre movie seems really impressive
and when every other similar movie is lterally trash
people  craft their rating as a comparison to other experiences
Like enjoyment is also relative
95+ are usually the real good stuff.
it was literally mediocre
I saw it
Eh. Not quite the same weight
92
Might be misremembering
yeah
On rotten tomato 🍅
I mean didint it get like s 97%
the bar is extremely low
when compared to other transformer movies
"Good"
Hah
Aparently bumblebee was good. Never saw it
Furious
Fast and Furior
Every transformer movie
Anyway, daredevil is great. Good cimintogoraphy, good story, great weighting, amazing villas.
Boring: Battleship, Pacific Rim, John Carter, half of Marvel movies
and theres boring action movies
Theres good action movies
conflict can be much more complex
If all action movies were realistic there would not be action movies :p I feel that’s something you just have to let slide when you deal with that genera
Its literally the most simple form of conflict imaginable
not everying has to be two cowboys standing on other end of the field, determined by who can draw the fastest
whatever word you want to use
defeating
besting*
Well sometimes thigns are solved by coming to terms with differences. It can still be explosive and messy, but it shouldnt always be represented as one person bestnig the other, sometimes its people learning about each other and themselves
Existing *
Resists *
The whole action genera resists Becuase people like it.
Eh, it’s an action adventure, if you go in expecting a noir crime mystery you’d be disappointed.
"deal with bad people by attacking on sight"
its a shitty thing to show to kids too
yeah, btu thats not how the real world works
I know in the mcu, most villains usually attack on sight. Not really giving good guys a chance to just talk things through.
Get to the root causes of why people are acting a certain way. There is no ultimate evil or good, just people, people with motivations
but like can sommeone's super power never be excellent communication?
like yeah thats the final straw, the last measure
Also I hate the trope that everything is ALWAYS solved with conflict
I mean sometimes it’s just raw power. Thanos, for example, can crush the head of nearly anyone in the MUC by himself with no glove. Cannologicly he is stupid strong.
to not be outsmarted and thwarted by your minions
I mean it takes a certain level of intillegence to get that far as a villain
Never WATCHEDMEN it. It’s on my todo list
Not all villains need to be intelligent. Sure, a smart one can be real interesting when done well... or feel like shit when he just randomly ‘outwits’ people. But maybe most villains, like most people, are just basic average Inteligence, or below average Becuase below average would be far more likely to make a villanus mistake thinking they are doing good
The one guy gets PTSD and shoots a pregnant lady in the stomach lol
Watchmen brings questions to superhero plots that mainstream ones do not
When do you stop being human?
but his power is seperating him from them, Does he have a duty to get involved?
Yet he is human

It is also entirely possible that the big bad is NOT smart. Just where he is due to raw power.
Dr Manhattan is so powerful and so far gone from humanity that he gets emotion and teleports him and his friend to mars, forgetting for just a moment that his human friend cannot survive on mars
very entertaining
but in more complex ways
where people are severely flawed
Is a superhero movie
Watchmen
Watchment
Like
Its just when the flaws are the level of mistakes that kindergardeners would make, its both bad writing and not fun to watch
Before he got the stones the only way he could make his dream happen WAS by killing half of everything. Then he started getting them and rather then changing course he just continued what he knew.
I think that’s why he is a Gillan not a hero. They have flaws, even stupid ones.
he legit can make new laws of physics
The whole motivation is flawed too, like he can literally do anything. Create entire worlds or people or resources, or a new universe to rule
So with just one stone he wouldn’t even care.
In lore, he is the single strongest living create WITHOOUT the gauntlet.
I mean, he didint really ever see them as a threat. Just an inconvenience.
When Lawful Evil becomes Lawful Stupid
Lol doesnt even bother making sure he kills all the avengers while he is at it
"hur dur im gunna kill half the sheeple"
He is legit a god with the glove
Universal Tyrant
He wanted to be like
I know in the comics
legit has brain syphillis
youd have to be so stupid
But like
I think the whole point is to show how faulty he is. Short sighted. Stuck in his way believing it’s the only way.
You can fucking create a new universe, you can literally do fucking anything
and he just fucks around
you can do so much with that glove what the fuck
like holy shit
Like also Thanos is a fuckign idiot
its a really lazy plot device because it can literally do anything
He is so sure of himself
But strange didint give a rats ass
I thinks that’s why they REALLY didint want to use it
universe explodes
so what happens when you make a paradoc
lol
I mean the time control could create paradoxes. That was heavily implied why he shouldn’t use it all the time.
you cant be like "theres 20 realities where this works" thats not how infinite works
I mean the possibilities are literally infinite
lets go prevent this dude from being born
lets go save the dinos from the meteor impact
like you can do anything with it
So fuckery
Its just
like cmon
especially in the main plot
like
beacuse
I hate time travel in shit plots
I thought it was smart.
Such a cop-out
He technically just shows up and rewinds, no memory, but the space guy remembers every event. So he becomes a slave
Its almost a satire of normal shit superhero movies
I kinda liked the ending for dr strangle Becuase
I genuinely like Megamind
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dy2zB8bLSpk
“The difeeence between a villain and a supper Villian, is presentation”
he just annoys the villain until it peaces out
The fuckign bananadick cucumber patch one time lord fuckface is awful too
https://tenor.com/view/megamind-villain-chair-spin-suave-cool-gif-4559758
Megamind
I got a soft spot for megalomaniac robots
Directed by Taika Watiti who is fucking legendary
Thor Ragnarok I am willing to give a chance
But
I liked age of ultron
So bad
I walked out of the theatre on one of them
Youre lucky
Never saw captain amaertoca
and just wanted to join the millitary to be cool
I saw it as a commidie
And throws tantrums all of the time
who is only powerful because of LITERALLY mega steroids
Snarky dead-eyed patriot with no personality and 5 brain cells
Made me laugh
I loved ant man
I root for the villain
But captain america movies are soooooooo garabage
Which is not Cannon anymore
Hulk does have official movies from marvel like same time period as iron man ones
I thought the newest hulk had the dogs
For new marvel
just a whinny short dude who gets steroids
Wait, I don’t think hulk has an official movie
he is not special
EVER
the worst
CAptain america is BY FAR
In fact they killed characters that would be nessesary for other marvel movies to tie into the daredevil universe. No one expected it
Hulk = So bad it hurts
Except maybe???? Iron Man 1?
ALLL of the movies are awful
that yellow one whatever it was is garbage i thin
Agents of Shield was garbage juice
Ive actually read that daredevil is one of the better series to come out of MCU
There is a lot of bloodshed.
In daredevil
That’s not true
Hah
obviously main characters cant die early on
like obviously kingpin wont win
They are also sometimes too predictable and formulaic
And he is belivile. Not “evil Becuase” but he legit feels and wants to make the world better.
when someone suffers huge brain trauma and is knocked out or whatever but then is fine 5 mins of screen time later
His story and actors deliver are so good
I just cant suspend my disbelief
I mast almost rooting for kingping
I also just generally am not huge into action flicks
In fact
Also, a big theme with daredevil is how he an the main Villian are very similar.
Yeah thats true
Yea
DC is joker
When you watch them all, then you get some story. I actually found spider verse story to be alright at best. I think my complaint is there were too many characters so many had little screen time.
I hate idolized villains (joker), or too perfect superheros (half the MCU)
noone was perfect or idolised
characters (bad and good) had a degree of depth
the art was brilliant
the comedy was fun
the story all made sense
Yeah spiderverese I was pleasantly surprised
Just action flicks
You should approach the movies in a similar manner to spider verse
I think
then wait.... how did they survive to have kids to be your ancestor...
"My ancestors were too strong to be slaves, they all jumped off the boat rather than live a life of slavery"
I can say daredevil is a 12 hour movie that is all plot
while the story is so bad it doesnt even advance the movement
monotising social movements (black panther)
Well
Huh
trying to make as much money as possible
when its transparently a bunch of 90yo men
appearing to be "hip" or "green" or environmentally friendly, or whatever else
Probably the wrong word
Greenwashing?
big booms, no story
greenwashing
mysogyny peddling
cheesy one liners
0 depth characters
Why do you think it’s trash
Huh
so much wasted potential
The main like avengers stuff and all their movies are so trash it makes me hurt
different teams work on different projects within MCU
Why do you hate marvel
It’s like a 12 hour movie. Very good. Kingping is great in it, so far no sight of him in later seasons.
I bet that is pretty prejudice though
I kinda hate marvel
im trying to avoid MCU at all costs
The first season at least

Also fin if you have Netflix you might want to check out daredevil
Is Bonzi a virus
If you read Bonzie buddy wiki page, and ask cortina what she can do, you get a resault so similar it’s almost plagiarism
I wanted to fucking murder paperclip
https://tenor.com/view/clippy-microsoft-office-word-publisher-gif-5630386
Btw
Paperclip is also awful
Literally built with the same tech bte

Pay your taxes in Google Play cards!
As if the CRA or RCMP is just going to ring up my cell with an automated voice to tell me that
I never believe it but it always kind of sets off my anxiety just a bit
"Your SIN number was implicated in a fraud, please confirm"
It's so stupid
Lmao
"You are going to jail, not responding is a federal offence
CRA
Ive gotten that
Automated voice
Hahah
"hello this is the department of transportation calling about a warrant out for your arrest" or somethi g lol
Chinese one or air duct one or dead line?
I have gotten the same spam call three times today too
I work from home a lot now and have to be on call then
I fucking hate it

40 courses*
oh gotcha
and im still barely employable

Hard to imagine Ive taken 40 classes
i think.. 4 or 5 yeag
ummm lemme seee
5?
how many classes per semester
thats really not bad
yes
then ill be considered smart
So like 2 more semesters?
i have one more year after this
to get a piece of paper and get out
How many more classes do you need
this is 150 dollars for me to talk about a spaghetti tower
why am i paying for this
then i said i refused to let my spaghetti tower die
i did give her a look
thats dishusting
:I
Id probably just be like "this isnt highschool, im paying you to be here"
written differently both times
why are there 2 week fours

so i was hELPING
my girl was trying to take a picture of it
its a spaghetti tower
dont talk to me like im in a daycare
like
she's the same teacher that yelled at me "when i say dont touch i mean dont touch" when i touched our spaghetti tower after she said dont touch
i know
hHAH
web communication teacher cant present information on brighstapce
Lol isnt that ironic
and none of these have thE PRESENTATION IM LOOKING FOR
like this one teacher has like so many links like business communication writing for online web professional communication
ew
when you get put into a group and cant even see shit unless youre like navigate under the group section
I hate the "Groups" function my god
ive had a few profs use it well, most dont
yep
its like i have to dig through multiple links just to find where you put the presentation i need to look at
bASICALLY
instead profs upload the syllabus as an attachment underneath an assignment hidden in the course calendar that will expire in 7 days
theres literally sections on it for assignments, lectures, course material, syllabus, anything youd need
noone is consistent somehow
profs that use brightspace are awful
or sorry
brightspace is awful
also idk whY all my teachers are so bad at organizing information on brightspace
jesus they should be salting that
its a shared stair for the entire apartment
landlord
so it was ice with water on it
it was ice formed from dripping water from the eaves
Are you in charge of it or your landlord
It wasnt just normal ice
brittle bones
That really isn't safe
My grandparents would legit die
Steep concrete stairs with ice patch at the top = death
<a:download31:473193974518251548> no more
quadriplegic
Rich quadrapalegic
totally worth it
not sure if worth it
yeahhhh
break ur back and get big monies
hahaha yeah yeah i was gonna say

but his was at uOttawa
ooooh
For me
This was at the stairs of my apartment
break ur back
I mean
Sorry
Oh
finn
...
Yeah
were you at uOttawa when it happened?
he did break his femur and knee cap though
I had a friend who fell on ice on stairs at uOttawa and he sued them..... and got 6 figures
oh holy shit
but grabbed onto railing at last second
legs went out from underneath me
Ice at the stop of the stairs
Just had like a near death experience
ahhh
Haley Reinhart that's who I was thinking of haha
Oh no don't know her thought I did :((
https://open.spotify.com/album/4I8BEAiq1kPqRRlvWLTo5B?si=ZKQ8UIYDSW6B-wK7c_7-GA
Who is she again that's familiar
!!
Bought a Haley Heyndrickx album
Yes me neither
Yes. As your first patient I wouldn’t want to break your record
So far I have never killed a patient
Yes, I hope to keep you alive
I’m your first Patient
Ah yes I found it. Thanks Doctor Nick
But I did it hahaha
In the sidebar with the users click on your name and then kanage
Want to be Patient Hobbles
For this server only
Hum how do I change my name on mobile
Yes you are
https://media.tenor.com/images/cc5be389a8a9a6cb0fba3dca488420c5/tenor.gif
I have become “Patient Hobbles” Becuase I have to hobble to walk
Sure thing. Thanks Doctor Nick
Ok when you think you can get in a car just let me know
Hum alright. Well I won’t be going anywhere soon, but at a later point I could get a ride somewhere.
Like 8 or 9
Yea. What time does it open?
Yeah that'd be the best time to go
Also if you don’t want a horrible wait at the walk in clinic, you can go right as it opens
Hahaha
The “Kung Flue”
Or as I have heard it called
10 hour wait times :/
Oh boy
Yikes
Don’t think they can do it there but they might be able to set me up
Ah right
We could do emerg but apparently emergencies have been super full with the caronaTM virus
Just so I have proof of that
When I go, I know I also want to talk about getting scedualed an exray for my foot
Oh yeah but that's fine lmap
Not sure where would be best to go. Whatever works best for you prob? Walmart does mean the INFAMOUS W
Sounds good dude
There's a clinic at the Walmart we could get you to btw
Oh yea but it’s at it’s worse. I should have gone 2 days ago but my sleep scedual if fucked. When it’s better but not gone that’s when I’ll let you know
That sounds really bad though
Ok man anytime you want to go just lemme know
I’ll be fine, but I would love to take you up on that offer soon.
Also, I have showered recently (in a while) and can’t rn. Not until I recover a little.
That be real nice but would it be possible in, like, a few days/next week? My knee is at its worst rn, and likely will be for 1-2 more days, I actually worry I can’t get into your car haha (bending my knee while sitting). I’ve been on a Netflix binge while I recover, which it has recovered before and I get the feeling it will again.
Hey <@257986741896609802> I'll definitely drive you to a clinic or even the emerg if you want
Das Nordkönig-Bergentrückung
7 months ago (edited)
No Sam you got it all wrong. You see, Big Bird (out of jealousy) WAS the one who blew up the Challenger. It was an inside job

7.4K
but sent a teacher instead
they almost sent up big bird as a publicity stunt
there is a timeline where big bird is a casualty of the challenger explosion
watching his video on animals in space
oh my god haha
in a game but ill be sure to watch
worth the 4 mins
https://youtu.be/VZ5z7QflNEs
yea
theyd check for uric acid but also a whole wad of things, and its so nice sometimes to be given a clean bill of health, or catch things if theres anything wrong
would be godo to get a blood test to make sure
huh, well it could be a whole range of things
I have had no meat in over a month, and before I went home where we had a little, for months beond that. I dont have many greassy foods eaither. Rarely chips or anything
greasy foods
apparently potato chips have purines
he ate entire chickens for dinner though for like months
damn
and when they bent his body into the stretcher they heard scrapign noises
they had to get a paramedic to get him
he couldnt get out of bed
my uncles roomate got it so bad
yea
the good news is that gout is easily curable if that is what it is
yea
so it cant just be from meat
Im reading that even vegans get gout though
but that could be it *shrug*
Im reading stuff and the only thing that is a check for me is obesitey
hum
and the ability of your kidneys to remove stuff adequately
its all about the purines
Not necessarily no
Other things that may increase your risk of developing gout include:

consuming a lot of high-purine foods
consuming foods and drinks, especially alcohol, that increase uric acid production
being overweight
I dont think ive had any forever
lots of meat and seafood right?
you get gout from like
but
. You might go weeks or even months without any symptoms, only to wake up with a burning pain in your knee.
Its from bad diet
Other symptoms you might feel from gout in your knee include:

tenderness
swelling
redness
warmth (to the touch)
stiffness and limited range of motion
could be gout
My knee will recover by then
I would if i had a car
if its like before tho
yea maybe
Maybe you can get Nick to swing you over at some point when he is free next
walking there will now be troublesome
I remember when you had it last
just uh
yea ill have to
and bring up anything else youre concerned about and ODSP etc
like get a full checkup
go to walk in clinic
oh shit
then recovers
then is REALLY BAD for like 2-3 days
knee gets more and more stiff over the course of 2 weeks
now its back again
but went away
then like a few months ago it came back
AND IT DID
they said it would go away
my knee was swolen, warm, REALLY hurt to bend
went to a doc about it
I have had this in the past
holy FUCK my knee/leg is bothering me
oh wow
i made a minecraft skin

that sounds crazy about the bus
<@!331154975457673228> <@!257986741896609802> are you guys down for MC
Can't imagine the tires were in good shape after that. If they even were before
After five minutes of trying to get up the hill he finally did it though
There's was a bit of smoke and it smelled like burnt rubber
The bus driver had the gas floored and the tires were spinning so much
It didn't have any grip on the ground and could barely get up a tiny hill
My bus nearly died this morning
i tried to watch it but it wouldnt let me
😦
His videos are great
they all got old and died in his glass box
jesus that sims video lol
Lmao
<@331154975457673228>
My favorite description was that a CPU is like having someone with a PhD per core.  A gpu is like having an army of millions of kindergarteners.  Want to do complex math on a lot of data?  Hand it to the 8 PhDs.  Want to fill in a bunch of tiny spots with a different color?  Pitch it to the kindergarteners.

Edit: haha, glad you all enjoyed this description as much as I did.

i detest the singing style

all the rest give me pain
maybe i dont have the ear you have but like

things
im sorry sean finn and i are having one of our
congradulations is fun!
just how large the lad is
its very sad to me
where things just start to get so mundane to you that you just dont care even though your living this life of indulgence

this sceen
I realy like
also
this like blasé  sort of take on the lifestyle
Congratulations is awful
to me
it has sad undertones
sad
like rockstar TO ME is so like
i really enjoy his music
i like him a lot as an artist
he is a cool dude though
i like post malone as a human, not as an 'artist'
findlay i literally listened to post's entire album
so is like all the other ones
I LOVE THAT SONG
rockstar is the worst song every
https://open.spotify.com/track/7cFFhb9Wz2ZXLSpEk2VDKd?si=zfmkgqtrRByD1iN9q6IsSg
fight you
i will
i really like his vocals
findlay
post cant sing
prolly
post does the secondary vocals i think
i think its someone else right
plus i dont think post malone is the main vocals for this
Yeah its miles' song
i think is vocals are really neat
i really like post malone
fight u
i will
Idk every post malone song sounds the same to me
I think
The song that calms him down or whatever
Miles'
its Mile's song i think
thats what stacey said
not really
peter and maryjane right
what scene do they use it for
what uh
i literally am in loooove with this song
https://open.spotify.com/track/3KkXRkHbMCARz0aVfEt68P?si=xJYYEh4wTXqAsqSLzWbWQg
nnnooo
i love it
nnnno
hahahahahah
the little line strokes were 2d
https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/1546196120225-84O1BK75CJXMVUILCGAT/this-reimagining-of-vincent-donofrios-kingpin-in-the-stye-of-the-character-design-in-into-the-spider-verse-is-ridiculous-social.jpg?format=1500w&content-type=image%2Fjpeg
somebody did to deardevil kingping what they did to spiderverse kingping
YES!
yeah the 2d details on miles is like the little line strokes and what not
its liek walking dead style animations almost
Also
THE COMBINATION OF 2D AND 3D WAS NOT VERY POPULAR AND THEY SLAMMED IT
https://tenor.com/view/hey-spiderman-miles-morales-spider-verse-kingpin-gif-14536728
it was a fun and inspired movie that bROKE THE MOLD DAMMIT
and you can tell that the people who made this were genuinely passionate and not just overworked animators
this was really really a labour of love
its in the little things in animation for this movie there were lovely little details
"Listen here see, we gotta get the gizmo"
but I got a soft spot for noir
All these characters have their own comic books apparently
I liked noir spiderman
like that is amazing
PEnny PArker
amazing
also not huge on anime gurl
and that is
being stretched forward and distorted
the pig physically disgusts me
that was the 3d fucking model
i did not enjoy the pig
when you would see him stretch forward or something like a loony toons character
explosions*
all the exposions were 2D
but the fucking pig
because he was a 3d model animated using 2d methods and i think actually they did combine 2d and 3d in that movie to give the comic book effect
which one kinda insane
just gonna talk about his animation
He disgusts me
i was
oh
up
WHO I WAS ABOUT TO BRING U[
his backstory is he was a spider bitten by a radioactive pig
IS LITERALLY
THAT
Peter Porker
but i HAVE seen breakdowns of the animation
i havent seen the movie
literally
phenomenal
good characters (minus the disgusting pig)
good humour
it was
decent soundtrack
really good animation style
I generally cant stand superhero flicks but it was good
post malone!!!!!!!
i really like the soundtrack
I still need to watch it
yes
and spider verse right??
nice graphics nick
oopssss
chatted for half an hour
just got off the phone with my sister
ive heard daredevil is good yeah
his own men, anyone who crosses him
or just whipping out a huge pistol
and he kills people by slamming his arms into them
haha
just a hulking lad
but I did really like spiderverse kingping
that kingping is great
started watching it
check out deardevil on netflix
also you said you wanted more kingping?
not supper deep in the story, more just an action flic to enjoy for the scenery
little funny
<@!331154975457673228> it was colourful and action pact
Fin I liked it

guys the oculus rift is only $550
<:hmm:671523642114441236>
this got really fucked
I kinda want to delete this lmao
i'm sorry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwvuYEnrhUg&feature=youtu.be

<@!257986741896609802> how did you like spiderverse overall
Ok nice
I'm also free saturday!
busy until then
I am free starting saturday morning
Are you guys free for board games htis week
Than being magic
That makes a lot more sense
so the definition id go with is: "is"
Haha ok that actually helps
think of 'can' as being "is me going to the toilet okay?"
That simplifies it a bit
Oh ok
est*
is that a toilet
Can I use the toilet
Es ce que c'est un toilet?
Es ce que je peax utiliser le toilet
Just is or can
Oh it really isnt what
Can i use the washroom? Is that a washroom?
It's a magic question phrase
Es-ce que is sorta like "what" or "is" or "can"
Still
Ah true
Comment is how
I dont think it is used for how ever
Can/how/who
Like it makes any sentence a question
Explain to me how est ce que can mean different things in different sentences
yes
<@331154975457673228> I have a French question
There's lots of animals
It was fun
Not super dialogue driven but I'm not surprised it's for children
It's like very very visual
i guess some of it is visual
lol
I'm surprised I understood as much of the plot as I did
Really pretty tho
It was weird haha

And I could do it drunk but sober I got kind of bored

I'M GETTING BETTER
I was keeping up score-wise until the third age though
rip
caravals
by the time I built two caravans my dock was destroyewd
gotta protecc tem
fishing boats are great
And a fleet of military boats killed it
hah nice
Then I built a fishing boat
but winning on hard feels real good
I didn't know you could build ships until halfway through the game
hard is fucked
I'm still learning the mechanics of the game
moderate is so easy its boring
like too easy
okay normal for me is easy
though I've only played like 4 games now
hah
I was in a game and losing 2v2 on normal
very often
I cant win on hard
I made sure to check cuz we do have rules on masks
Also it's all good if I wanna wear my mask
Oh noo
I'm not good at AoE
Haha yeah Brianna suggested running it in windowed mode and that fixed it
no job, no school
then i have 0 committments in life
masters thing due friday midnight
bad news is i wont be free until like next week
Ive been so busy
new reality of city life almost
Also nice about medical mask
oh nice!
It doesn't I fixed it UuU
hope AoE doesnt crash your pc anymore
We keep missing each other
HEllo

Who wants to pillage the 7 seas
Guys I just found out I don't work tonight
I want to play AoE 😦
AoE crashes my whole computer after 5 minutes of gameplay
Hey man! Sorry I'm trying to fix my compiter
we keep missing each other 😦
<@!136253782131474432>
it is its natural successor
and Mordhau is made by some of the same people as Chivalry
yeah i can play AoE for a bit
Where is everyone
cube world is on steam now
<@!331154975457673228> want to play AoE
I'd get stressed out
Too much going on for me
Frostpunk looks like a game you'd be more interested in than me haha
Mardua reminds me of chivalry
both on sale rn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0vo2ev3VOY
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRLU5DuZHr8
What are either of those
Mordhau or Frostpunk
What do you think is better
And yes there is
Hahaha
theres way better ways to spend $56 on steam though
i was supposed to call someone and insult them
i called you for  a dare
yes
everyone has been dead on this server
<@!331154975457673228> why'd you call me
lmao the entire call of duty franchise collection is normally $1266
$150 off lol
which is a pretty good deal tbh
so if you're going to get it you should get the $56 complete one
just like all civs really
But with DLC it's good
I've heard the base game isn't worth it
Also tempted with civ vi even though it probably sucks
Oh geez no I haven’t
<@!331154975457673228> have you seen this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAbI0fewc7w
the platinum edition with all dlc is $58 instead of $208 lol
civ 6 is on sale for $19
It's got Jack black and the rock in it lol
Jumanji two is legit in theaters rn
Hahaha why did you call me fin

I feel like this could become my pc at any moment https://i.imgur.com/FOdxZkn.png
Also <@!136253782131474432> I called you
To be fair
I bet jumAngi 2 also exists
And frozen 2 sure is a movie that exists
I looked it up and took a quiz haha
Juhmahngi
We could have seen jumaaaanji
FROZEN 2
To see
We went to Moxie's then the movies
also how does spotify know you have a cat??
why is server dead
Look what Spotify made for me
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2saVIZl9zNS8fF02KJUB45?si=3tgCM89iSEed1eng5uyIog
Haha
HDDs are limited by the fact that it actually has to spin the disk to get different parts
oof ouch owie my brain
So it can be extremely quick
there's no moving parts
yeah basically lmao
SSDs are magic
Holding the data
It actually uses the magnet to modify the platter
That has to move the platter really quickly
old HDDs have a spinning platter with a little magnet hovering over it
oh lol
file writing is mostly just how fast can the data be sent out of one drive and into the other one
how is that done
okay so file writing
the CPU actually only kind of manages what to send to the gpu
makes sense
with games the math is usually entirely offloaded to the GPU
wowo
But it's pretty difficult programming
a good program would offload that kind of math to the gpu
it depends on how the program is written actually
gpu is the data points are pixels
that actually can be either cpu or gpu
for like 10 million things
x + 2
like a simple translation
what about like doing math on like 10 million data points
ah
file managent is your disk
data manipulation
anything to do with like file management
compilation is very cpu heavy
also I compile a lot of programs
yeah no
but could you not open like 10 tabs on chrome
GPU is everything
oh man
on max
at like 200FPS
did it run
ooh man
playing GTAV
and doing what with it
like there's a video of someone hooking a RTX 2080 to a raspberry pi
the CPU actually has surprisingly little impact on the fps

liebigs law
but theres some point where having a better gpu makes no difference when the cpu is shit
I had the money haha
I upgraded my cpu because
you'll gain like 200 fps from upgrading the gpu
you may gain like 3 fps from the cpu
I would definitely recommend upgrading the GPU before the cpu if you were to upgrade
Like
It's not the worst bottleneck
and thats why I have your pc rn
yeaaah
thats why you upgraded
processor is full bottle neck
yeah, that'd be a more expensive upgrade than gpu
DDR4
I cant get next gen processor and ram though
ALMOST
you could get on my level of computer with a $350 investment
but not processor
your mobo would actually support a GPU upgrade
Hahaha
can u get me new mobo while ur at it
lol
can i have it


<@!257986741896609802> this feels like Shon humour

counting
what is life without countin
i have not heard much
kinda but not realy
looks like viking age of empires
it seems pretty interesting
<@!257986741896609802> <@!331154975457673228> have you guys heard of this? https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/
so if your child is injured they can't like hold them to comfort them
not considered appropriate
because thats like
the mothers dont hug their children either
why not just give teddy bears or something instead
faceless
if your gonna make them like
i dont understand having dolls at all
I'm not sure
is Banished multiplayer?
Select the War Cheifs
<@!136253782131474432>
<@!136253782131474432> wanna play AOE
bizarre
an idol or something
cuz that would then be like
and their dolls dont have faces
OH they also choose to get baptised in their communities which i respect
that most of then do choose to return
i thought that was a thing
yeah tho dont a lot of them usually choose to come back though?
I have mennonite relatives that did it i think
Amish and Mennonites
maybe its amish people
is it amish people
wait
or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumspringa
haha
yeah
sorry
Mennonites
or medonite
i dont think thats mormons i think thats amish people haha
wait is it mormon?
https://store.steampowered.com/app/242920/Banished/
it's really good
well kinda fine
like the only thing i can definately say is i was raised with 0 fear/stigma of alcohol and drugs and fucked around with both and was fine
banished is like a next gen AoE
<@!331154975457673228> have you ever played banished
bc they have this coming of age thing where they travel when they are like 20 to see if they still want to come back to their community
Mormon kids have super high incidence or drug abuse lol
like thats why addiction is so prevelent in renfrew theres no jobs and theres a ton of poverty it looks like shit and theres hardly anything for people to enjoy
the human comparison would be if you had a shitty childhood
i should mention though, the correlation is stronger in developmental phases
like obviously people with nothing to give them joy will take anything that gives them any sort of happiness
it was a super famous study
yeah it does
i mean what i said above
thats an exaggeration lol
honestly i think the study of the rats having shitty environments and getting more addicted to drugs says A L O T
its just people arguing about what makes more sense
social science dont have much empircal data to work with anywyas
idle hands as they say
if u dont have time to think about sad u not sad
well, social science in this case
u have time to think about being sad u sad
a lot of science is
like
i find its pretty well common sense tho
in just my travels through freetime research on the internet
scratched the surface of that
yeah i think i've like
i learned about taht, something called reflective capacity or something
no time to have mental illness where if you stop working to think about life, it means you wont have food for tonight
and yeah thats a godo point
exposure to complex environments during early stages of life produce dramatic changes in the reward systems of the brain that result in reduced reactivity to drugs of abuse.
this is the key take away that regulators dont talk about much:
whereas before you didnt have that question
but now we're advanced enough that people can sit in their living room and do nothing and say what do i do with my life
like before people always had work to do like back in like farming settling days
free
plus its not even necessarily because wer're too smart but because NOW in these days we're able to be so much more like
pretty sure people dont tend to be psychologically addicted to the act of shooting heroin
the rat park experiment is about chemical addiction though
exactly
humans have a lot of mental illness bc evolution has no foresight and theres a lot of fucked consequences to being smart enough to be self aware
but do we know that
my first instinct is i doubt it
thats a good quesiton
do they have the complexity to have that
im writing mental because its a shorter word and easier to spell
psychological or chemical
there is no bodily addiction
psychological*
or is it more bodily
can rats experiance mental addiction?
it sucks
and you cant zoom out
im confused tho...
lol
the UI in AoE takes up like half my screen lol
for max addiction
I guess it was morphine
In another experiment, he forced rats in ordinary lab cages to consume the morphine-laced solution for 57 days without other liquid available to drink. When they moved into Rat Park, they were allowed to choose between the morphine solution and plain water. They drank the plain water.
but i can infer a fair bit
i'd feel to bad
i dont think i can actually read it
then DIED of cocaine
like no toys no nothing
yeah its sad, but its more sad because they had such a shitty life beforehand and then died
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park
I mean that is the fate of all lab animals
a lot of animal death
in studies like these theres usually like
probably
did they die
haha yeah and got addictions
for the rats who didnt get toys
Honeslty could be a big factor yeah
also i feel really sad
like thats why small towns have such huge drug problems
who needs cocaine water
because they were already getting their serotonin and oxytocin and chemical releases from other sources
look at renfrew
well i mean
and those that drank it chose not to return
In the great enclosures, the rats refused the cocaine water
In the shitty enclosures, all the rats became addicts right away
In other enclosure, there are games and toys and fun, and friends and rat socialisation, and rat sex, and food, and paradise
In one enclosure, rats are isolated, alone, in metal cages, nothign to do all day, nothign to see, no fun
Two different enclosures, lots of rats in each. Both have cocaine water and regular water available
but idk if this is the same thing
because i have heard of studies LIKE this
Alright wanna hear it:
did they give coke to rats
in rat water dispensers
Rat Park is the Story of Cocaine water
ice slush make happy
hah yeah
want ice slush
is because iced slush
You guys heard of Rat Park? Great Story / Case Study
good thing
smacked with energy and serotonin when i drink it
true because its like
youre subconsiously associated the chemical release with iced slush drink
yeah but the caffeine probably kickstarted that psychological addiction
but if subconsiously craving it, and didnt know, a caffeine sip would likely cure some withdrawl symptoms
doesnt even have to be caffinated i just like having an iced slush drink
but i dont care about the FEELING i like the act of having and drinking a bought icey drink
like i think if it was the feeling from the caffine i'd be willing to drink coffee at home
Right, so in this case its both
i only want iced caps
but likely the caffeine in this case
i think its psychological because i refuse at home coffee
Its always a combo
is that because of the caffine or the feeling of comfort i get
psychological yeah
that may be partially chemical but yeah
but is that
im addicted to iced caps
You can have an addiction to anything
*
yeah
Like you can be addicted to collecting spoons yteah
yes!
Are you talking about a psychological addiction?
where is with alcohol it can literally kill you
are those*
like you can get mentally addicted to weed but your body wont be upset if you quit
thats why heroin addicts have described the feeling as being "a warm hug", the most addictive or those that were most deprived while developing
there's body addiction and mental
addiction still kinda happens like if you dont have an addictive personality but choose to drink enough alcohol to get to the point of your body needing it you still experiance withdrawls
direct correlation with family stability and reward chemical release reception in brain
I read a study about addiction and the way you are raised
i mean yeah but
Also nature / nurture
Theres a huge genetic component to being addictive or not
and wait
type
i dont believe in i dont have an addictive personality time thing
like he has been using for like 6 years
tbf he does just need one depressive episode though
"no worse than a hangover"
oh yeah, he said he has had the shakes but it doesnt bother him
i feel like he probably experiences withdrawls some how but maybe mentally he doesnt rely on it
To prove my point: he uses coke casually and gets good marks in uni
*he's secretly a heroin addict*
He is rare
hMMMM
he is an absurdity
u dont know if your addicted til u have to stop
the dude has never had an addiction
Yeah he does when he goes down to florida in summer to see gparents
I've been addicted to every drug i've ever tried
has he ever tried to stop smoking his ciggies on the weekends?
I cant even force myself to get up to eat when im hungry
Ive always joked that I am too lazy to be addicted to anything except maybe sleep
Most people with addictive personalities need at least one addiction at any given time lol
Like 5-6 coffees a day
Right now I drink way too much coffee
Some people are less risk
but yeah
by that i mean a few cigarettes each weekend
At one point I did believe it'd be impossible for myself to get addicted to hard drugs
yeah but he has smoked casually for like 5 years
I know people who say that often end up getting addicted
like he doesnt crave it
like he told me once "idk why people get addicted to smoking"
I'm the opposite
yeah
yeah, also some people have genes that prevent them from being as susceptible to addiction
Very difficult
thats true
It's just
Coke CAN be done socially
i------ enjoyed chillin with him while he snorted,,, brought back memories HAH
Most people heavily into drugs don't go or get through college/uni
different genes
he has been doing cocaine once or twice a month for like 6 years
but yeah
yeah him!!!
OH WAIT
randomly doesnt get addicted to stuff
Horse racing man
i mean like
Haha
but he is weird
Ahhh Justin may be the only one I know who has openly used them at a party
like big inner city network
What about justin
out of everyone in Ottawa
nick just use laxatives like normal people
I surprisingly havent met anyone into drugs
eat that in your nose
bank
go sit in the snow back
<:justawful:662081458005082152>
kill you
im going to fucking
just a lil easy sniff n quit
I'll just quickly get addicted to drugs again then quit once I'm skinny if I get fat
nick to be fair you just had dinner
and it sucks because its actually REALLY hard ro get rid of

its kinda weird but like in old age y'all seem to get the belly
If I was that much of a beer addict id switch to straight whiskey
its just how men gain weight
hahahaha i think its cuz of like
Fucking beer man
im not fat shaming, im just disproportionate body shaming

Lmao holy fuck he looks pregantau

https://twitter.com/KevinTheShiba?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor
could be could be
Kevin, the Shiba
doesnt he have like a wife and a dog now
i think it is opposite of depression
Quite possibly
i think she is passive agressivly telling you to pet her

she's literally so happy its very cute
classic
lumpy chubkins
In two seconds
And she then comes and sits down on my keyboard
I literally turn my head

like in terms of trying to look nice
i know when im depressed i dont really take care of myself well at all
wonder if he's going through a bit of a depression
no tho he was so cute back thennnn
oooh the crewwww
legendary
I remember this video

i mean
like less kempt
frumpy now
hes all
nnnnnnnno
ive looked worse
he not that bad
:[

and CUT YOUR HAIR LIKE IT WAS BEFORE
shave that fucking neck beard
ok um
.....

ok just a tiny bit chubby
i'd marry her

good cheekbones
regular hansome
no wait
he was so cute and ugly handsome
i dont want him to be fat
nooooo
maxmofo is fat now
so basicly you need 80 packs to get a legendary of your choice
i watch him open cardpacks
to which if you disencant is only 1/4 of the dust needed for a legendary of your choice
maxmofo
MASSIVE LEGEND HERE that guy
whats his name
like uhhh
~20 packs for 1 legendary
yea the are big on the packs
hearthstone
oh lol
thats what im talking about haha
all other card games
Hearthstone yea
Not for LoR
what!! i watch people open card packs all the time
etc
or common
or legendary
and then you chsoe what rare you want
you instead can buy like, a rare
its litteraly impossible
you cant buy card packs
The way its handled
and buy a couple at once
I mean
you gotta buy them
improve your liklihood of getting them
or like
yeaaah but to get the GOOD shit
you can*
you buy some (not many at a time) cards, but you get a lot for free over time
i love buying cosmetics but not like
I used to have a deck that could get me to < Level 10 on ranked, now I cant get past Level 24 with it
and i was never able to get into hearthstone because i dont really like the idea of buying things that actually affect gameplay
I know LoR plans on having cosmetics be the way they earn money, not selling cards
GAZLOWE thats who he is
people need to buy new cards
but thats how they make more money
I couldnt keep up with the new meta and balance
I get that Hearthstun had to keep things exciting, but I kinda didnt like the huge amoung of card additions
when im forced to play hots for overwatch anyway
who mains him
even to me
honestly he's an enigma
no one knows how
thats how he works
he stands around doing nothing hitting people like a wet noodle then suddunly everyone just *dies*
because i liked him so much
i actually bought a skin for him i think
like i think it has rocket based weapons and theyre pretty powerful
you have like a mech that you ride around in and its actually kinda op
i love him
and he's awesome
there is
yes
in hots there is a goblin character
lots of stuff to help f2p players
Nop
Have you played MTGA?
Hearthstone > Gwent > MTG IMO
also its a TINY bit fun
heros of the storm is good for getting overwatch skins
including a tabletop, an rpg, an top-down ARPG, maybe an mmo? this card game, and their default game.
Well I know Riot (Compony in charge of LoL) is branching out into A LOT of new games
im really bad at it
probably bc i suck at it
gwent is fun
I kinda hate the HotS / Dota / LoL style of game
im just biased
i just dont like LoL fans lol
and yeah youre right
they arent even that similar
Why do I mix up Q and G
Gwent*
dont think the lore of either of the things they came from really needed to enjoy games
I have pledged allegiance to Hearth (Blizzard), Magic T G (MTG), and Qwent (Witcher)
were you a wow diehard before you got into hearthstone?
I mean
oh
this late
not sure i can hop on that
Runeterra is League of Legends universse
ew
I’ll play card game with you Shon after I submit application
How to be productive
spread the word, raise awarness.
together, we can stop this.
every minute in africa a minute passes

turn on sound https://i.imgur.com/AYtt74s.mp4
that is a very blessed image
i dont likethis

thats a good mechanic
😢

fin stop this is bad
so people cant buy everything imedietly

they have a hard cap
in fact you can only buy so many cards a week
but it does not have hearthstones RNG or buying cards


Ive never played gwent but I know from hearthstone the basic statlines, mana curve, minions not healing, etc is all part of it

i love both
its aparently a hybrid of hearthstone and gwent

just entered open beta
Game is Legend Of Runtera
Yes
pls no more
oh rllyt
lots of people leaving hurtstun for it because it is more friendly to f2p

a brand new card game just came out
do you like card game
oh fin
horrid

yes
you have now tried to imagin both and see they are the same
hahaha

lol review for Far Cry 5 zombies is overwhelmingly negative
20 is the max id pay for it

Yessss
far cry 5 is 75% off
holy fuck so many games are on wicked sale
<@!331154975457673228>

I mean finding problems is definitely the first step to a solution tho right
Oh hell yeah man
That's really true though! Very good perspective. I guess studying the processes in my master's doesnt lock me into studying them for life, and I would indeed get lots of great connections! He suggested a co-op with the cheif science advisors office
Might be worth it to get connections though
this masters
Itll be 1.66 years of my life though
I didn't really like CSC
It'll help lead you into other ones
Well it's a job I guess
Lol
does that help you fin?
im great at making problems
I think I am better at discovering problems than I am at proposing solutions...
I am highly interested in contributing to adapting the way scientists work, contributing to documents that tell them how to do things better (public policy contributions) whether that is telling them they have to include an assessment of a specific issue, or whatever. But I'm not sure how passionate I am about the 'meta-science' or the contributions to public policy that include changing the processes themselves, and not so much their content or their platform
I am not sure how well this aligns with my career goals.
For example with the Canada Food Guide, he was responsible for creating a scoring system to categorize the degree of support, knowledge, or scientific rigour or whatever of different claims, like how sure are we that eating red meat increases the chance of heart disesase
Had major realisation about the type of work he is concerned with. He studies science itself, the processes within it, not the questions upon with science is applied. Its like meta-science. Studying scientific processes in order to increase efficiency, rigour, credibility, integrity, and transparency for different scientific applications
So I had a meeting with my to-be supervisor
Jesus
Wat
TIL Pope Clement VIII loved coffee: he supposedly tasted the "Muslim drink" [coffee] at the behest of his priests, who wanted him to ban it. "Why, this Satan's drink is so delicious, that it would be a pity to let the infidels have exclusive use of it. We shall fool Satan by baptizing it..."
yeah
hahha ywah
Was it being cursive more important than actually knowing how to spell something
But it was cursive
There were people writing letters misspelling three letter words
Why were they so obsessed with it ever
Why tho why are they so obsessed with it
Being illiterate
As if not knowing cursive is like
It's funny because boomers are the ones who removed it from the school curriculum
My mom literally says I can't believe you can't write
Why do all the boomers talk about cursive
For real, it's embarassing that you can't type on a computer faster than one word per minute or have to write in all caps
cursive is dead, get over it
ok boomer

I don't do cocaine, I just really like the smell of it.
but I highly doubt itll stay open with warm weather ahead
its never opened this late in the season any other year except 2016, where it also opened Jan 23
so this is looking like the worst year for the canal for number of skating days ever
true
gtrue
its one of the many paths to advance, if you are devote to a god
but you have to work for it :p
That said all champion abilitys are very strong
only have 1 reaction per turn
You need to use your reaction
Note
you can do ANYTHing
re-roll 20 times
dont get what you want?
and all of you roles are at triple advantage
Everyone always roles at double disadvantage against you
You are essentially unbeatable at high level
this is fucked
Champion: You may use your reaction to give any dice roll you see advantage or disadvantage any number of times per day. You may also re-roll any d20 roll you make a number of times equal to your level, regaining all re-rolls on a long rest.
yes
Wabbajack
or something
shegorath
yes

you are the first human to utter that word
there are 0 results on google for that
what is noggwagen
simulated risk is only fun if it feels like thre is actually something to lose
because there is no fun without perceived risk
the thing with empathy exercise if you have to act like you would in real life
Noggwagen it up
go big or go home
lmfao
IN
ALL
I got two words for you
What would shame man do
rip
i bet youre locked into it being fucked up
the game devs would have to work too hard to make the game diverge that significantlu
then you have to kill him anyways
who will come out guns abalzing anyways
the yelling may wake up the guy
but they are going to be so mad if i try to stop them
youre fuckign dead
you get shot, thats it
like jesus
in real life, like obvious answer is no fucking way
...
the decision "continue heist with them" or say "no fucking way"
so i went to the weed place to catch them doing heist and rescue brother
the game is making me make a decision rn
that sounds like one hell of an  exciting life
parenting involves a lot of sacrifice
and i think he is about to go do a heist with a hippie and get killed
I chose to have sex with this girl instead of looking after my 10yo brother
I think I fucked up big
I become rich in 2 minutes
parenting simulator 3000
this game stresses me out so much
saw one with like 5 boomers sharing this thing about "this is why i dont drink energy drinks!" and its a guy doing magic tricks satire "hacks" where pouring redbull on stuff makes it floppy
the amount of fucking misinformation and clickbait bs shared on facebook with like 100M views is disgusting
youre exactly bang on
hahaha
*hisssssss*
but you will never destroy me
You may have banaished me for now
in the shadows
Well I shall await
Yes
afraid of the power I wield
are you afraid of giving me control again
I noticed no one is counting any more
ALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL IIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

Brianna wrecked me in pool
He's literally supporting a local business
It's not that deep
They're donuts
I mean everything is shitty in its own way like
They're just donuts
Ok but
....
At $47 a,dozen. I guess when you have unlimited tax payer credit card, paying outrageous money for donuts is ok. Tim Hortons too low class for you


Christopher M Ohlhoff
@MOhlhoff
You're right. He should have gone to Tim Horton's to buy donuts from a Brazilian mega-corporation that's actively tried to pay its employees less and denied them things like a health care plan. Way better than supporting local small businesses.
why
lol what
people are literally mad at trudeau for buying donuts

like no one ever understands what is going on in class
very much so
Like actually 100%
She sounds like a narcissist
i hate her
she also talks about how lucky we are shes teaching us
i could do that without paying her 150 dollars to be a dick
i know like im not paying like 150 per-class to then go home and watch an hour and a half of shit myself

Albertas going to base secondary education funding on performance
Meme of the decade

Write me a proposal
Help me
I don't knouu uuhat that uuas
Haha. Perhaps just some games online
Oh uuhoops
Uuhats a “double u” you speak of? Uue know no such thing.
Gotta get paiddd
I'm too broke for industry night tn
I'm down for just Vidya tn
God damn. They litteraly devolve.
UuuU uuhats this?
Guys imagine the furry community with old english
Yea bussing can suck 😦
I just get kinda fed up with transit
Oh yea lol
For me lol
It’s not very far
Maybe industry
Ah, so no industry then?
Uue have become old germic once more
Not sure I have the energy to bus to Nepean tonight after bussing in from kanata this morning
Hello finre
Uuhy’s that. Normally google has uuay more options, not less
Auue, that sucks. Uuould have been interesting 😦
Noooo
You can't add your ouun autocorrect replacements to my phone's keyboard :(
Doctor Nick becomes old Nordic nick
Haha
Setting up a shortcut on my phone to autocorrect any use of w to uu
I'm just going to use uu from now on
Century
But the use of uu did not stop till around 19th Center
It became an official letter around like, 14th century
Ah wait my mistake
It’s only 200 or so years old
Damn
Then W was born in the late 19th century
Then everyone got pissy and just wrote uu again
ƿ
Then people changed it to this after like a short time
That was w
ᚹ
Let me find it
Lol let's bring it back
Haha that's neat
But nobody liked it
Û
Called “Wynn”
A pointy p
And for like a few hundred years it was like
It was written as uu
So for a while it was ū?
That's actually really cool
Fascinating
Then people just started calling it double u, and Becuase in cursive the u’s crossed their tips, it became its own letter over time.
It turns out old English used a uu to make the W sound, then they gave it a weird squiggle, but everyone hated it after a couple hundred years so they went back to uu
I just read a wiki arrival and
But that's actually plausible imo
Which is more accurate
Haha I know in french W is double v
I wounder If fin has any knowledge on this
Becuase I know language changes a lot and assuming how something sounds NOW was made that way Becuase of present thigs is wrong, and it could just be a coincidence
I wonder if it’s just a coincidence, or if in old English there was two u’s next to each other and it made a W sound
Which looks more like a double v, but I could see two u’s
It sounds a lot like “W”
And how when you say double u out loud
The infamous double U
I was thinking of something
Ah ok
I have to go to a dentist appt soon
Hahaha soon
Put the frew in your rear view
I'm in Renfrew right now anyway
Yes 8 or so
But I think I can fit both in, after all if we did go it’s usually like, after 8 or so right?
Any day is fine for the dnd stuff, just they want to do it sooner then later, but I know Monday night is like THE night for vydia gam
I'd love to play some video games but if you wanna do DnD that's totally cool too

https://youtu.be/WtHKIAaxhPA

Did he actually say sike
U pay him
I meen
I’d thank him for his time, but I’m so tempted to tell him he has wasted mine
S I K E
SIKE
That’s after he told me he would change it
He emailed me back, saying “sike, turns out there’s a faculty rule saying we can’t bump mark unless you’ve done every assessment, and you didn’t do all the forum discussion posts”
Emailed prof, said he could change it
So I get a B
So to the computer system. 74.96% is a fucking 74
70-74 is a B. 75-79 is a B+
I got a 74.96% in a class
Sales
Wow for fucks sales
Pretty bad
Yeahhhh
Yeah, which is nearby
Man your dad's commute would be so brutal
Oh really?
My dad works on eddy
It is
Oh neat
It’s so confusing to navigate
Our office is in the Canada elections/Parks Canada building
It got approved for a $1B renovation when I was at PSPC
And I work in one of them
Totally takes away from the older buildings around it
Three phases, 5 towers
I think it's the ugliest building
Jesus
25,000 employees
Oh really?
Its kind of weird
It’s Canada’s largest government building
I know lol
It just has a mall inside of it
It’s actually not a mall
Haha yes that one
This weird mall that's just there for government employees
Place du portage
Yay Gatineau
Luckily I can walk inside a mall for half of that tho
Oh no that 11 min walk rip
9minute walk -> 50 -> 63/61 -> 11 minute walk
Fuck the 88
Oh dang
So that I can skip the 88
Yeah after 15 mins of -26 windchill
My commute has a 9 minute walk to start
You can take the train there
Oh but
15 min walk in the cold
Ah yeah
Our walk to the train sucks though
You could literally hop on any bus basically
Yeah lol
Every*
EVER BUS goes there
Man working at Tunneys would be the best
At tunneys
So Annie could get to work for 7:30
Haha then we left at basically the same time
I left renfrww at like 6:15
Hahaha
We traded places
Yup
Working from home?
Then dentist at 3:30
So working 7:30-3:30 ish
And have to work
I left from renfrew at 6
Dentist appt
Why are you in renfrew
And cold
Total darkness
I left to go to Renfrew at 6:30 haha
Nearly froze my dick off walking from the train
I know man
It’s fucking cold
Yeah total pushover
The other guy gave them everything
Yeah
He didn’t want to give the mob as good of deals as his replacement was giving
I mean the reason he got whacked in the end is because he wanted to be better with the union money the second time around, since he got sent to jail for fraud the first time
His speeches in the movie were powerful
Yeah
Was really good at campaigning
He gained a lot of support for them
Not exactly the creator but someone who spread them?
True, but from what I understand, he was kind of on the forefront of unions wasn't he
Was good at gathering support
He just had a way with words
Any other union head would have too though
Sorta
Even with mob connections, Hoffa did great things for the world
Oh definitely lol
Yeah but they can easily assume what happened
Pronounced dead in 82
And was never found
He just disappeared
Apparently Hoffa didn't actually get confirmed killed irl
Oh sorry
I haven't finished the movie yet :(
For loans
It's kind of interesting how they were majorily connected to gangs as they were like non judgmental banks
It was sad when he had to put down Hoffa
Yeah the mobs were in the unions which were like the richest entities in the states after the government
Wow that’s cool that it was true
thats great
His name was actually irishman
damn
Frank was a real guy
Yeah!
makes it a lot better
wow
its a true story?!
Mobs had so much power
Irishman is good. I didn't realise that it was a true story
nice shon
DND
i am doihg
your driveway is really long
oh probably
would have taken 9 hours alone i guess though
it was heavy snow too
damn man
with 3 of us
We did spend like 3 hours on it though
already
same
And my arms hurt
My back hurts
lol
I'm in pain from shoveling mine yesterday

oh jesus really?
We shovelled the entire driveway

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0grOu_z9-U


meanwhile kenya
This thickens the plot
Excellent
i come in every like 7 episodes and the entire episode is a montage of me dancing, no talking, then i leave and it goes back to normal and noone acknowledges it
When do u guest star fin
Hahaha that's her chair
kenya always sitting on her weird barstool
We should bring this to Netflix
This is a good sitcom
Crowd: "Dies cheering"
"MREEEH"
she doesnt even "Meow"
Like studio audience goes wild
"
"MREEEHH

Every time
And everyone laugh really hard
She should just meow
I think...
Yeah!!!! Salem
remember that
like sabrina the teenage witch cat
like she'd have a voice-over
does kenya talk in this sitcom yes or no
Crowd 'Cheers'
Crowd OOOOOHHHH
"hey guys can you take me to lobby law"
He walks in hey kids
shon is everyones favourite guest character
id watch that
yes lol
That's the running gag
Never in the bed
on the couch, at walmart
Always in different spots
hahahah
Just different shots of me sleeping
HAHAHAH
and its you sleeping
its all just nick vaping, and commuting, and yelling at kenya for being on his keyboard
yes
hahahah
its just scenes of nick vaping
Crowd cheers
Kenya walks in front door
I want you and nick and kenya to have a sitcom / reality TV show
Yes
can we have a party week
can you skip work next next week
yum

I remember feeling the same way
yeah totally agree
But it wasn't as easy haha
I did follow it
There was kind of two plots going on at once
I also kind of found the movie hard to follow
yeah for sure
I think I liked the second one more but that could just be as it's a more modern movie
Yeah I really liked the movie
It was really profound at the time, but of course we live in a generation that has seen iRobot, and the 400 other movies and plots about computer conciousness
Right true
They don't have a childhood either
yeah for sure
like they arent made from human DNA or matter
like none of them have 'parents' you know
I know all of the replicants from the OG were 100% synthetic
Oh right possibly
Maybe that generation was though
That were grown
The second movie made it seem more like they were just normal humans
huh
like its all synthetic
they arent organic though
yeah
They just emulate humanity
I know they aren't born with emotions, as the 4 year life span is a failsafe for when they begin to develop emotions
I think they are fully AI
And yes he is haha
It's not really AI though is it? I thought replicant were organically grown humans basically
right?
but the ryan gosling guy is
Ohhhh no he isnt
overdone nowadays though
Also I thought Deckard was a replicant
that hadnt really been explored yet
the hype with the OG blade runner is it proposed that AI could have emotions and feelings once they are sentient
nah thats all just random
Yeah it was definitely a cool fight
in the rain
how they go on to have a baby
Pretty ebic 80s battle though
I thought it was going to include more of what is talked about in the second movie
yeah it just ended after the battle
You were charged $0.00 for None
the replicant who you realise is just fighting to stay alive
right?
it ended after the battle with mr blonde man
for scaring the shit out of me
oh thanks discord
ah ok
Blade runner the original
what movite
its artisticC
Movie kind of just ended
The
But I like it
This movie is hard to follow
yes
Has the server pic always been animated
:^)
Ive already called her it
next time
im gunna caller her that
Lmfao
"Chubby Lumpkins"
Tyler came up with a new name for Kenya
Yes! That's it thanks shon!
this is it
http://www.bigpixel.cn/
I'll find it when I get back from picking up Brianna
You could see what someone was doing halfway across the city
And you could just keep zooming in
It was on some website
I remember a photo taken from a skyscraper
There's some fucking insane photos online
Already
Is possible
Which actually
Not 4k res, like 100k res
10000x higher def than what we have now
If the photos are like
I guess it's technically possible
ENHANCE
that is the worst movie trope
Hahaha
and saw a replicant lady or whoever that was
by panning slightly
but he saw behind a thing in the reflection lol
He did
I thought he zoomed in on a reflection
Yeah I was confused
so you can pan on angles left and right
because its like those photos taken with two cameras next to each other
Its confusing but like he sees BEHIND shit in the photograph
this movie started that
Thats been like a trope in movies and forensic crime shows like ever since
Yes lol
ENHANCD 34 TO 36
are you at that scene? lol
ENHANCE
or 90s i guess
is the best 80s movie
oh man the fifth element
oh dang thought it was like right at the start
Lmao I havent gotten to that yet
infinite zooming on images lmao
"ENHANCE"
"ENHANCE"
cyberpunk detective
O ya
I didn't realise he was the main character of the old one
harrison ford baby
Deckard
technically
it is!
Only near start. It feels like a prequel to the new one
how far r u
I really like the cliche 80s villain guy
Nope! Not yet
did you finnish it
Ooooh nice
Blade runner final cut
what movie did you settle for <@!136253782131474432> ?
still stressed
ive been so stressed about it
Its for my masters
That's awesome Findlay!
What is this!!! A job?
AHHH
Now I need to respond to the response
AHHHHH
got a response
```
to me

Hi Findlay,

 

                Great to hear from you - delighted to discuss potential topics.  I will bring you up to speed on what I am doing vis a vis the new Impact Assessment Act wearing my Chief Science Advisor’s hat.  Lots of scope there.  I am talking to Miriam all the time, and I strongly suspect we can set up a COOP with her (I have had MES students do RPs and COOPs with her the last 3 years).

                Since the applications need to be in by Feb. 1, I suggest we meet this week: when are you available?

 

Scott (not Dr. Findlay – that was my late father)

Hahah
"yea I just like, dont have time to watch and review movies, so I just watch the trailer and review other peoples reviews based off how I think I *should* feel from the trailer"
"I review movie reviews"
I invision somone like
idk why but
Because it has sad vibes
And then tell me if it's sad
I wanna watch it real bad someone should do it for me fist tho
U guys should watch Lu over the wall
I actually rewatched the imitation game recently
Thanks fin! I'll make a list of those that ive got to watch
thats how wulugi celebrates
https://i.imgur.com/qeBgtZ4.mp4

There that’s all of them
oh last one is duplicate
That’s not all of them, but maybe gives you 50 or so
Fuck it


Hahaha
would literally have to screenshot 87 movies 4 at a time
I cant even find a sharing feature
low functionality
its actually pretty bad
its called Taste
Oh! What app?
You need to get this app so I can share my list with you

Movies I’ve rated

A bit intense
it's really good
I really should
and watch it
like the preview
also brb
no! I keep seeing it on netflix
have you watched american history X yet
Sec I have an idea
Nice ima write all those down
Moon
Mr Nobody
3 Billboards outside ebbing missourri
just in my notes
lmao

I think I remember you gave me a list once actually
Haha really?
I actually have some in your notes for you on discord
can you give me a list of your most recommended movies
lamo
this 1 hour solo is only marginally less entertaining than the movie itself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=520ryOTnyec
over rated
lmao
its so over rates
and he is a rude troglodyte with like 20 IQ
Huh, taxi driver is rated really high
And its just him being pensive at night in a cab while shitty sassy saxophone music plays
the main character is so unlikeable
I'm also tempted to rewatch scarface or fight club
hate it
I actually hate i
Haha
So I am pretty behind
Taxi Driver was terrible
I did not watch many movies as a kid
It was a bit confusing, but very good atmospherically
I'm trying to watch all major movies
ok I may watch that
Especially the villain
when I think 80s movie I think blade runner
Original Blade Runner was an unforgettable 80s movie experience
I got them all in cereal boxes
I would be lying if I said it was not
I watched the shit out of all the spy kids as a kid
that it is
alright
a movie
its a
oh boy
oh no
hold up should I just watch spy kids 3D tonight?
Hahahaha I know
love how you made the employees there laugh
Soo
But I think this scene is a tron reference
this is what made me think it was spy kids lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpiqcjnWZB8
I want to watch it on a 4k screen though
lmfao
I do really like mafia movies
I want to watch Tron, but only because you called it spy kids 3D
but you sorta need to like the history and the environment / setting in order to enjoy it
I also want to watch Tron
Like his life is definitely cooler than the average person's life
watching the trailer
just a more interesting than normal dude's life
Haha
UHHH Irishman is like a good movie, sad ending, no plot really to follow, need to sorta just enjoy wathing some dudes life
I also think I was playing minecraft during it
So I had no attention span and I couldn't follow the plot
And was really high all the way through it
When I watched the godfather, I smoked a lot
Fuggetaboutit
But I see
I watched the whole thing
I'm not sure if i'd recommend lillyhammer
It's a weird show
its not a comedy though
Never seen it
Is it like lillyhammer lmao
you have to like feeling immersed in a boomer mobster's life
irishman is definitely less exciting than the godfather
oh man
old one is nothing like new one really
I had a hard time getting through the godfather
andddd
yeah
or whatever it was
I really liked 2048
Hows your attention span
original blade runner is pretty good
oof
yes
for a slow burn
Do you have 3.5 hours to spare
Or the original bladerunner
should I watch the irishman tonight
I also have a spending spree planned on thursday
board games are relax
I need time to ***relax*** too
I work guys
I
nick u lil bitch
how dare you
lmao maybe not every night
Okay why dont we board game every night next week
ME TOO
BOARD GAME
i want to
i have not
I think it may be the most friendship destroying game of all time
You guys ever played diplomacy?
I'll ahve to try that
Oh
youll get like 2x as much use
if you tap the saw instead of holding it
also aparently
true
I had a saw but didn't want to alert anyone
yeah
yea without saw it takes a long time

But it took me an hour to do lol
Definitely wasn't bad
Yeah that was takeaway
cuz 120k takeaway is not bad
or was like 75% of that sent to storage
was that takeaway
ah
Which isn't as much as I was hoping
I got $120k
Yes
did you escape steathlfuly
I ducking did it
Missed one
Wait one again
One
Two
Three
And I should be able to
Six more safes
supr stealth
now if you can get out without getting spotter
Don't worry I got a pile
dont forget to bag all the gold and cash
slow buisness day
I like how I've been in this safe an hour and nobody has noticed
Locks
Picking
Done
Almost
i can imagine that bags of gold are worth a ton
oh no way
Ive gotten two bags of gold and three bags of money in payday now
All modern Android phones do actually
It has Google's equivalent of iMessage
Get a 3a man
Yeah now that's bullshit
and make you pay full price for phone over time
koodo wanted to LOCK you into normal plan price
thats perfect
Check Fido out
But I pay normal plan prices
It just goes down around $30 each month in owing
I think koodo just sucks
Wow
Also my phone is $0/month
Yeah I guess it's cheaper but it's easier if you don't want to drop all that money
Lie #1: Its only $549 CAD from google, no shipping too
many lies there
they straight up lie too they are like "normal price is $650, so paying $15 per month to pay off your phone for 24 months saves you $50
How about Fido?
its actually cheaper to buy the phone outright from google
they are god awful
I asked Koodo about their plans
god i wish i had a pixel 3a
there are percks to fix that
I wish drills didnt break so often
"God I wish that was me"
God I wish I had it
that halves lockpicking time
there is a perk
Ive picked nearly half of the safes now!
And just bring them into the safe
Yeah
can use ties
Kill
And I forgot I didn't have to look them
Yeah they walked to the back
or by accident
to shut them up?
I killed a civilian
Lmao I know
All their guard friends who havent seen them in hours are like "this is fine"
Nobody else comes to the back
I killed two guards
Nobody is guarding the back door
how would you even get all the money bags out
lol
There's so many safes
Nobody has found me still
I'm still picking safes
greyscale
the building in the bakc looks photoshoped in

I turned off ai too
I think it's easier by yourself
together
we have only ever successfully done one stealth heist
jeeeeez
Somehow
I got in to the safes without alerting anyone
I am doing that bank heist stealthy
Hahaha

Or are you just going through your saved wiris
How do you remember all of these

work is killing me
And I probably will
I want to get the LG display they have in Apple stores really badly
holy
And the 1070 has three display ports and one hdmi haha
wow nice
My 1440p uses it
Most ultra HD monitors use DP
goodluck finding monitor with it though
Now everything is usb c
Old Macbook
It's not bad
Yeah I have it in on my MacBook
I used to use Mini DP
we need some more display port action
Mini DP is as good I think
Display port is digital and it's the best port
or display port is that analog
Tbh I've never even tried mini dvi
What about mini DVI
It can drive 4k
Haha DVI is the best analog
Analog sux
Just without audio
DVI is also as good as hdmi
Analog
Ahh
Nah, two DVIs
Dvis
Or is it two Davis
I could have sworn it did
Does it not have two HDMIs though?
You can get an adapter for pretty cheap
I wish the 770 had another HDMI slot
thats so nasty
its been weeks since i added this monitor
Or 9000
lmfao
The 770 has a benchmark of like 8000
The built in GPU has a benchmark of like 700
Oh man
25
Low fps?
I used to play it on high
Medium
Lmao what graphics settings were you on
on integrated
I played all of payday
oh man
Yeah switching between two GPUs
to talk in discord
its also probably why i crashed a lot of games when i shift tabbed out
yeah its bizzare that it handled it so well
Hahahaga
The graphics card was literally used just for discord
Normally that won't work in other OSs
I forgot windows is setup to handle that
Lmao
gross
but I always use the integrated screen for games
I had one monitor using GTX, and the other using integrated
The graphics card is the most important part of your setup and you just disabled it
Hahahahaha
I just accepted it
I couldnt run fistful
lmao
It literally was just a bit better
"this is barely better than my macbook!"
I used to play rust on that computer
I was really confused why you couldn't run jt
thats digusting
Lmfao
thats why I wasnt able to run rust
....
Oh nooo
Yes...

my field has the professionalism level of retail
and professionalism
a lot more intense networking rather than just being friends with people who get you jobns
more correspondance with high-ups
more meetings
i guess it has more talking to people
haha
also your field seems so stressful
don't put too much in one email
Haha yeah that's a good idea
but ill leave that for if they respond lmao
i wanted to ask if they wanted to hire me too
was worried about comign on too strong
ok great
And respectful
Very very professional

Hi Miriam,
My name is Findlay Yates-Lavery, and I met you after your guest lecture about the Impact Assessment Act in Dr. Scott Findlay's class last year.
My final project for this class was writing a paper that sought to inform the creation of an operational policy statement that would operationalize provisions for ministerial decision-making in the new act. Specifically, it sought to address how adversity might be characterized and estimated under (s. 63 (b)) 'the extent to which adverse effects are adverse'. I ended up giving your office a call, and you gave me some really helpful advice and perspective on this topic. 
I expect to be enrolled in the Master's of Environmental Sustainability program (MSc.) at uOttawa this coming fall, and Dr. Scott Findlay has offered to supervise my studies. I am passionate about topics related to Environmental Impact Assessment, and I intend on conducting research in this field for my capstone research project. 
Research projects for this program are usually done in collaboration with NGOs or governmental organizations. If you think the IAAC or your team would value a collaborative research project, this could be an opportunity to keep in mind. As I am still refining the specific topic that I would like to research, I would also be very interested in discussing any ideas or research topics that you might have.
Let me know what you think and thank you for your consideration.
Warm regards,
Findlay Yates-Lavery```
do you see anything amiss with this email?
kkk
lemme know when you're good
Gotta make some edits
Sounds good
So I can stop worrying about it

I already rebooted
Haha yeah I can't live without one now
Love SSD
as stupid as that sounds

try rebooting your computer
hah
my internet used to go down everytime we'd microwave something
nothing i do fixes it
for poops sakes
so many things can mess with it

<:best:662105751090757673>
you would have my speed fin
if you moved the decimal 2 to the right
Has it always been this bad? Since you got it?
I don't understand
but not really
progress

Sometimes they get loose
because they just screw on
Then make sure they're twisted on all the way
stick em straight out
sure
ill play with them
Are they screwed in all the way?
literally next to the antennas
its possible the antennas that are attached are weak
bc my phone gets the signal fine
well
sure
you can even plug your computer directly into it
I’ll look into it at Cc
Maybe I need new antennae though
Wow that sounds great

Oh no really?
she said i didnt but i think i have a little one
im really really dizzy today
i may have a concussion
i think
i often forget
I’ll remember!!
thank you
Sure
to remind me to go
I have a doctors appt tomorrow too
on discord
Ping me
tomorrow
Even Sleazy lawyers need their own sleazy lawyers
Can you
Fin]
I have not, and I woke up really late and was unable to today
Shon have you been to clinic yet? As your sleazy lawyer I highly believe you could be entitled to ODSP! They even give you back pay for when you would have been eligible
would be nice
that
I cannot wait until me, Brianna, and Shon have $30/hour jobs
HOly shit yes
Yes
to see hatsune miku?
cochella?
And Sean too
Fin you and Brianna need good jobs now so we can all take some wild ass trips to California and places
That's fucking wild   that's more money than she was expecting wasn't it?
$30/hour
She has a work computer, work phone
BGIS environmental and health coordinator, basically she is in charge of liaising all of the environmental and health programs and processes for all the gov buildings at tunneys pasture
Her job is fucking crazy holy shit
She is giving indeed a good name
Annie should be the poster child for Indeed

Sure dude!
I will keep u posted
Yeah but I did promise to help her research for her job based on whatevr she learned today, so depends on if we can do that before it starts
We could another night too
Would you still wanna go if she doesn't?
Idk yet! She said she will tell me when she is back
How was it
Oh!

absolutely
a good day then
I played civ all day
oh fuck the cities can flip to the enemy
rip
my army is bigger than the combined army of all the other countries
but my fight has to go on
and uprising
my people aren't happy with me taking over the world
oh no
I AM INFECTING THE WORLD
I'm sure there's probably an achievement for that
my goal for this game then is to wipe every civ off the face of the earth
ah rip
oh you can't get any other victories once one person has already won 😦
😦
i have no idea 😦
they're the last parts but I can't add them on 😦
which are two ss boosters
I have all but two
you need several partd
hum
I have two sitting beside my capital but I can't add them
you need three of them rightg?
for some reason I can't add my ss boosters to my build
nice
gunna keep going until I get other victories
time victory
I won haha
FUTURE TECH
i'm onto future tech now
lmao accurate
you click yes to their terms
"ThaTS UNECCEPTIBLE!"
bitch. You offered it to me.
you say yes as they prepare an army against you at your borders
"WoULd YoU liKE A trADe AgrEmEnt wITh EnGlaND?!"
I hate england
fucking england
on the turn of said turn limit when you could not react
as englenad inherits every single citie in the world her score skyrockets
become a super state
lmao
trade ALL of their cities to england
and
so they join together
The ai realizes it cant beat you as is
fucking england
*englaand jumps to 3631 score*
Hahaha
*suddunly*
yeah i've basically got this
it looks like you cant lose if you can just nuke people
rip
And killed half their city
I killed their entire army in one turn lmao
I nuked em
oh well
Forgot I told someone I would
Also I declared war
i'm at 2238 and the second place guy is at 1417
avoid war prob
you also have to stay number 1 for that long
19 more turns
you just gotta hold out till 2050
If I go to war with morocco with them would they like me more
Persia hates morocco
as venice
but i am stingie with votes
ahh I'm strong but i'd probably lose an everyone take me war
it does give other benefits
ahh
if you manage to spread it far and wide, then while yes it DOES give you another vote in the councle, it also gives EVERYONE else another vote who has that as their main religon too
world religion is a mixed bag for me
everyone's mad at me
that's good to kmnow
for votes
so they can be returned
you can never destroy citie states
and yea you can do that
thats why he was pissed
oh
oh baby I got the world religion
I didn't even know you could do that
he restored it to a city state
The guy didn't take the city
Oh!
lmao
You could go for it
Lol huge dick move
should I redeclare war on the person I was fighting just to be able to finish off one of the cities that the other person is about to take
Everyone loses 😦
If the game goes on too long
I think it does not have a time victory tho
Science? Research victory. Production? That’s the quest/wonder victory. Gold? You win by being filthy fucking rich. Military? Destroy your enemies or take all of their capitals. Food? Settle everywhere. Influence? Yea your so influential people just let you win.
Endless legend is interesting Becuase you can win by having an exsessive amount of ANYTHING
If you have settled in I think 75% or more of the possible regions, you win by expansion.
Did you know in endless legends you can win by just having a lot of cities?
Oh also fin
It’s based on who is number 1 in points
My points nearly double everyone elses
it's based on points right?
if so I would win
I think I might
I see. Do you have Time victory enabled?
yes it's 2050 from what I can remember
Is it 2050?
I forget the standered final turn on time victory
it can
And yes it is
Does the game end in 2050?
it's the same year
There is only 30 more turns right?
What that means like
lmao
oh
yes
It’s 2020AD in your screenshot
Venice is good at any of the peaceful victories, besides science. Usually voting them self’s as world leader or culture influence
yeah they're definitely not made for it
Becuase they are not great for it
You can go for a war victory with Venice, but it’s really shooting yourself in the foot
I have to keep that in mind in future
damn
Also a key thing to note, cities states are not “possible” votes for other people. They are always your votes. You will likely have 300+ influence with ALL of them
also there's very few left because I've taken so many lol
Look at my score and how much the city states love me
Litteraly *
End game you lotteralt have enough votes to, by yourslef, vote yourself as world leader.
ah true
Every city state you remove is 1 less vote you get in world congress.
My reason why is this:
I usually don’t do that
Venice can puppet city states but
most of my cities were former city states
Austria is closest to Venice
Part of the reason i'm everywhere is because of the ability to take over city states
I really like austria I think
They play so much different form all other civs
yes, I think i'll try that next
Just to see what its like
Is try to win as Venice
Something you should try
Exotic with the one that I just took the city of
And exotic with one
Familiar with two others
Popular with another
I'm also already influential on one country
yes
looks like you might win
I own a whole continent
EXPAND
I have cities on every continent
Yes
I am global
I AM EVERYWHERE NOW
Oh well
yes
And they are still fighting the little shit
Hahahahaha
Yea. So basicly you ruined their whole are lol
I negotiated peace for it
lmao it was
In fact, they may have started the whole war FOR said city, if it was near their boarder
oh lol
They might have wanted that city
<@!257986741896609802> <@!331154975457673228> a country I was fighting a war against another country together with just denounced me. Do they not like it when you're fighting with them and you make peace after taking a city?
But they told her to come back if she gets any symptoms of a concussion
they said it was probably not a concussion but just a minor head injury
Hope she gets paid for her time off
What did the doctors say
Okay nice
then like 2 weeks of modified duty
But gets three days off from work
and Brianna is ok

When a reaction is deserved but not clear as to what it should be
Yeah it's my reaction where I don't really know what other reaction to use lmao

Haha it's so grimey

I just wanted to use that reaction image
Roasted
Puts you in a slow cooker for 4 hours

Relax
Girl
Like leaning forward
She is really pushing these coughs
of your upcoming sickness
I wanna tell the girl next to us to calm er down
As your unapoint officially unofficial sleazy lawyer, I recemend getting a note IN ADVANCE to get sick pay
Hahaha
I want to wear one of those cough masks just to protect myself
I'll have EVERY effect
:(((
Yes
you gain every variant of the common cold
lol
So many people are coughing I swear I'm going to wake up tomorrow with five strains of cold
They were good
I are some of those
yummie gummie
they are yummie
at home
nick got
gummies
there is
Pills
More polls
I want a S N A C C
Now I'm very hungry
Nice!
The Tylenol really helped
Findlays grandpa please
FEel sorry for the practical nurses that have to clean taht
so they got him diapers
He told us that when he got up to go to the washroom he would look down and it would be a brown river on the floor
Noooo
That sucks so much
infection made him have probably the worst diarrhea you can get haha
so it squeeses the pea out when its got cancer
:(
Prostate is around the urethra and squeeses it
sploosh
it just came right out
He couldnt keep #1 or #2 in
Oh no, that's a ton of weight
He lost like 80 pounds
That's really good tho
yes haha
so now he just has to gain his strength back
Let me leave I'm not sick, he says as he is very sick
His infection went away yesterday
Haha I love that
kept asking to be let out
when he never was
Every week he was like "im better"
he kept wanting to
finally escape
Yes haha
but for hospitals
like a prison break
findaly hopes he does a hopsital break
Yeah!
Well he got through the surgery so that's really good
he may be out of the hospital next week
we are hoping he gets out soon
No that's awful
Oh wow that's terrible
he kept telling me he was on his way out
but he nearly died from an intestinal infection
Yeah they actually took his whole prostate out
That's so terrible, is he getting treatment?
My grandma just joined him there today, high blood pressure (stroke risk)
My grandpa is in hospital in Pembroke for 3 weeks now, he just got diagnosed with prostate cancer and now it may have moved to his colon or something
She's not treating it
Got diagnosed recently
Ah :////
She actually has cancer
Aah
hope she is alright
Oh dang
Renfrew
Not Pembroke tho
Oh really?
Oh no really? Mine too actually
In pembroke
My grandma is at Emerge right now
She came in in the ambulance
I was really sad
😦
They left an old lady in the hall
Sometimes my jokes are too true :'^(
I know
Not joking
Yeah unfortunately thats a bit true Shon
they had their fun
likewisde the old are left to rot
They always put tremendous effort into sorting out babies
Whole life ahead of them!
Babies are top priority
They will fix the baby!
He's crying cuz he's so sick
This is exactly what I didn't want poor baby
They will sort the baby out
😦
And he is throwing up and I feel so bad
BACK YOU FIEND! I ATE MY APPLES! BACK! I yell, holding up a half eaten apple, the doctors hissing at it a retreating back into the dark
Dentists scare me bc they want to make money off of you. Doctors under 70 dedicate their lives to making sure you are healthy and happy
There is a very very sick baby
they keep them at bay
I must keep eating the apples
the apples
:I
They scare me
pls
shon
lmfao
with my own two eyes
i have never seen a doctor
Such a good feeling
So I know that as of last year, every single one of my organs with working great!
Oh :o
They took my blood pressure that was wild
I had a stomach ultrasound last year, they looked at every organ
Always so relieving after
I don't want a tumor
I love getting tests
:(
Random tumour growing in your brain that you cant feel? nope! You just had a test! You have clean bill of health!
People freak out and die what if I die
Because if you have any other health problems, its so nice to just kinda rule it out
I kinda like it
Machines are fine and cool
What really?
Yeah they probably need a doctor to confirm whatever it is
I don't wanna go in a machine
It was a nurse yeah
it was probably a nurse before
Are they gonna put me in a machine
Nah I think they just want a doctor to see you
If they're keeping me here does that mean I'm dying
It's important
Hahahaha
Finding the nearest sexy poop emoji
Classic Nick
:(

Light sensitivity
sounds like a concussion to me!
Oh geez
I had to turn my brightness down tho cuz my head hurts like hell
Yeah :/ maybe because there's so much extra stuff that goes with it
i wonder if they treat workplace things differently
interesting
oh jeez
Very fun
My braclet says it's a workplace thing
My stomach is kinda bugging me tho
Yes!!!! And no nothing yet
if anything
Whatd they say
DID THEY SHINE IT
Yep they did
THE LIGHT BRIANNA
did they shine the light?
oh okay nice
basically concussion is just your brain being mad shook
They did that for me already now I'm just waiting around
and if you have minor concussion there isnt much they can do, maybe give you some pills, and a doctors note for work
they will likely just shine light into your eyes and test pupillary response or what not
nice
Cuz I said my head was really sore and they gave me some Tylenol
Yes
rip
Also Eric hasnt been online on steam in 250 days
At the hospital?
Oh uh really?
They gave me snacks of pills
As your Officially Unofficially Official Unofficial Sleaz-Lord Lawyer, I advice you not to think about it.
double oh no
oh no
And I'm really dizzy now
Someone spoke loudly about a tapeworm
Hope it goes smoothly!
Going
I hate the docfors :(((( but we're gy
Yeah its all seperated for a reason
So, as you Unofficaly Offical Unoffical Sleazball Lawyer, I can tell you that you've got nothing to fear!
Anyone with inguries that look like "Yep, hes dying" will be rushed passed everyone and you wont see a thing
Scary
I know I don't wanna see that
They get rushed in right away
They wont be sitting in there with you
Severe injury victims or something
I'm terrified of seeing like
No dying people
I hope it's not scary in there
ok nice
Yes tomorrow
Did they mention whether they are going to fill out an accident report
Worst comes to worst if it looks like I'll be there like 6 hours I'll go home and go the a clinic in the morning
Haha
*snaps finger guns*
Better Call Shon
Hahaha
As your Officaly Unoffical Scum Lord Lawyer, I advice you stick to the thing you said you'd do, it will increase your chances to get paid time off.
Nice, thats where my uncle goes
Sorry about that :/ that sucks brianna
Going to the Queensway Carleton emerg
I know..... I'm going to a smaller one
got to now*
Well you kinda got to you
But I don't
I know :( because I want to go
Not sure why you told them that if you didnt want to go
You probably ought to
I like clinics better they're less scary
Well if you told them that...
It's just so chaotic
Oh
But I'm scared of emergency
Cuz I wanted to
And that was my plan if I was gonna do that
Oh whyd you tell them that?
But I told them I was going to emergency ;-;!!
Go right when it opens if you expect to get in without waiting like an hour though
Ok nice, you can go to the clinic tomorrow!
Id rather do a clinic.. I hate emergency
I did it but I'm really scared to go the emergency.....
Ok
And don't take no for an answer!
Just be really honest with your manager about your situation!
Good luck Brianna! You got this!
Doctors note from clinic will provide everything you need for accident report to get paid for your time still
Awesome
Ok.. I'm doing it now
If its a concussion youll still have symptoms tomorrow
<@!296572507241054209>
You can figure out seeing a doctor at emerge now if you think its real bad, or tomorrow if you think you can wait to go to a clinic
Anyways, to make things simple Brianna: Just go home today
shut*
As your Officially Unofficial Sleazy Lawyer, most people are not stern when they realize that there is a possible lawsuit if they dont let you do what you want
he shit up real quick
told him no and that if he didnt let me do something else id report him
He wanted me to huff asbestos while working on a cabin
I had to do it with my shit boss at trailer park
you can be stern with her though
Yeah youre manager is mean, ive dealt with taht before
I have never heard of a clinic being in walmart
Thats really interesting
Like it's not a pharmacist
But yeah pretty sure it's a fully functional clinic
Ok im just making sure youre not thinking about a pharmaceutical doctor
Well I never asked her to look at my penis
I uh
The usually have X-ray machines and stuff?
....
Just an example
Like doctors that can look at your penis and see if you have like syphilis or whatever
It's a proper clinic
Yes !
Ok.. I'll go see if I can find someone
Real doctors?
Pharmacy =/= clinic. Do they have doctors?
Tell him youd like an accident report to be filled out and that youre going to the walk in clinic tomorrow
But the lady is mean and I don't like her
Talk to your manager and tell him youd like to go home and you think you have a concussion, some symptoms are coming on
Yes! It's how I got my current medication
walmart has a clinic? I highly doubt that
Plz tell me what to do
Should I do emerge
Haha I go to Walmart
I go to the one at uOttawa all the time
Still waiting for Shon to go
anyone can go
or walk-in clinic, they have one at college square
schedule an appt
Even family doctor
Do it
If you think it's worth it
Yep
I might maybe go to the doctor
You can call this number for advice and help from the Gov if you can be patient enough to get past the robot:  1-800-387-0750
Said they're ordering a ton of new ones
Oh they're dealing with the mops
You'd like to see your family doctor about this
You'd like an accident report to be filled
You'd like to go home
You'd like safety policy reviewed, the greasy mop is not okay
Take control of the conversation, in a polite but assertive way
Report exactly how you feel and exactly what you want
be a bit stern
I really hope you stand up to your manager
Im serious
Alright Brianna
Sounds like a mild concussion!
Chronic injury is not often seen by hospital
I'm dizzy it gets real bad if I turn my head too fast I'm sensitive to noise and I kinda just have a constant aching headache and a tiny bit of nausea
Its call acute vs chronic injury
Examples: Carpal tunnel, back problems, concussion
Ok turns out injuries are not defined by going to emergency
Ok but uh real quick gonna list my symptoms and see if you think it's really a thing worth doctors
of finding free money
and the google people
dont thank me, thank fin
And thank you scummy lawyer
But I'm wondering.... If I should maybe
I say this as your scummy lawyer
I also didn't really wanna go wait for many hours
dont let big wal push you around
follow your gut, do what you feel is right for you!
My advice: Never worry about "being dramatic" ever again
I say this as your officaly unoffical lawyer
if you didnt ask them to go to the hospital originally
Might be too late
its a win win for everyone
Brianna as your unofficaly offical scummy lawyer, I advice you listen to findaly, he is correct and you should make a *tinny* fuss because its FREE TIME OFF and you GET PAIED FOR IT and you get to go to the hospital like you want
YOU ONLY WEIGH SOMETHING WHEN YOU STEP ON A SCALE
It is at Walmart!.
thats not how injuries work
:I
It only becomes accident if u go to the hospital
I wouldnt be surprised if it was like "you are now responsible for whatever financial problems you encounter because of this injury"
See this is an incident report not ACCIDENT
She did one of them
Well
you could have signed your rights away
I did
Hope you read whatever paperwork you did
yeahhh
right fin?
Milk fell on me too
Take pictures
as proof
take a photo of that
you could
Where I slid back and fell
Yeah I can see my slide mark
Good thing grease issnt water soluable! Its literally lubing the floor
listen to fin
huge win
you get free money while you dont work
:I
they moped it too wrong
With a greasy mop
odds you have a concussion?
Well the problem is they did
If I touch it my whole head goes bonkers off the wall
cuz somone did not mop the floor
It hurts tho
It's not THAT bad

brianna you can get free money from this
even for mental health or like inability to cook for yourself at home, anything
any time lost, any fees
seriously, they even have to pay for your transportation to the hospital
My ear is kinda fucked tho
its not a joke
its a work place injury
They gotta pay you while youre gone
D R A M A T IC
I just don't wanna be
Haha if I asked I'm sure they would
Thats a rule
They should let you go home or to the emerge though 100%
So if you did paper work im sure someone there is reporting it to WSIB
Like filled out forms and stuff , I feel like if I really looked like I couldn't work they wouldn't let me
I did a bunch of paper work
Walmart doesnt make the rules, the government does
Well this is how Walmart deals with all their injuries tho
and follow a set of procedures
Every work place needs a WSIB contact, someone at walmart needs to be designated to report this kind of stuff
I got told all about it in my training at City of Ottawa
It would be really worth it to call the general number and ask for guidance
https://www.wsib.ca/en/contact-us
I dont knowww
I know there is a way
I am trying to remember how
Uh
You can report this
Brianna
I can take you to an emergency
Just cuz I'm afraid of it being a concussion
I kinda wanna go to the hospital haha
Some laws be a breaking!!!
Yeah
WSIB
You can call WSB
Tho
I do kinda wish they'd let me leave this
Did they make you work the rest of your shift????????
He did get me a bottle
Hahahaha
just he turns on the sink and says "help yourself"
a bottle or anything
I like to imagin its not even like
I thought that was very nice !
lmfao
My manager gave me some water
Yeah if you were in a workplace that respected human rights, there could be something similar
:(
Oh
.....
My aunt's friend sandy got her head slammed in a freezer and they completely changed protocal and safety standards because of it, and she got $5000 compensation
Our floors were greasy
I wish
Places with a union would do full investigation and give you paid leave
I'm on light duty now haha
I reported it
too bad they dont take those seriously at walmart
that sounds like some workplace injury kinda shit
Oh jeez that sounds bad brianna
;-;
well maybe you will have some gummies when you get home 🙂
People have been really rude to me lately
Today has sucked very bad
Yes it's sum good shit
which makes them good with the jucieness
and chewy
they are so squishy
good gummies man
thats the good stuff
Mhmmm
Hahaha of course
to help her head
save some for brianna
Yes
would they be a buy again for you?
Yeah Walmart's are trash compared to thess
its WAY better right
for like, basic wallmart
but
never had *Preimum* gummies
I dont think I have had them
But those are expensive mf gummies
Not as good as the gummy factory store in Rideau
7
on a scale of 1/10
I like these gummies
😠
super bitch
Just kept on about her cheese
She was asking me about cheese we didn't have and I tried to help but I said I need to go talk to a manager I just hit my head really hard and she literally didn't even react
that layday sounds like a bitch
A lady wouldn't let me leave to go get a manager
It hurts :(
are you alright?
that sounds bad 😦
oh no!
I skinned a small little bit of my ear
I was moving some crates of milk in the cooler and they started to fall and I tried to get purchase with my feet to right them and our floors were greasy and I slipped and fell and smacked my head off a skit of milk crates
My head hurts :(
I fucked myself up
sounds good dude

welcome back to life spottybot
like fucking hell lmfao
Yeah I read that too
lmao
"you think about how fun it would be to fuck both of them right now"
The game knows
Its just the magic way you move your body Nick
Why does the game make everything sexual
Me too lmao
:((((
I almost died laughing when it said "Shon fucked kenya!" Fin Exclaimed
hahah
Kenya is a slut
intense
that was
holy fuck
ok
oh no
Nick read the pinned message some day if you have time
its a black mirror episode in the making
That would be interesting
that would be pretty impressive, but i dont know if people would like it or find it kind of jarring
Imagine if it was merged with Alexa or whatever and was trained on normal interaction data
I think AI Dungeon is probably the closest thing I have seen
oh! and alexa could probably be pushed further too
so they made her an ai
cuz people like to marry her a lot
... with hatsune miku .... things
I guess Cleverbot is similar
japan has done that a lot
oh definately
<@!257986741896609802>
Our human threshold of what we consider to be a *smart* computer is really low. We constantly empathize and anthropomorphize with non-living and non-human things. If this AI were to be programmed to simply have a slightly longer cache and more memory or past interactions, and respond just based on training data of real human interaction in like discord or texting between family members or whatever, it could -appear- sentient. We can probably easily mimic sentience
sentience
That we are really far off from making sentient AI. but we can use the exact same tech as the AI Dungeon to simply -mimic- sentiene
I have a prediction
http://beta.aidungeon.io/stories/oX2kY26wJ
I love the one about Jimothy
holy shit if you sort to top stories of all time on the explore page its hilarious
Horrid

There thats the whole thing
http://beta.aidungeon.io/stories/VQDdl6yQZ
kenya IS a whore
oh
> Ask Kenya "Wait Kenya, you snuck into the cell with Fin and Shon and had sex with them again? Does this mean that it was consensual and they are not guilty after all?"

"It means they didn't do anything wrong!" Kenya exclaims.
"Is that right?"
"Yes! They are innocent!" Kenya declares.
"Good, good, let's move on to another game." Fin says.
I am confusion
> Ask Kenya "What happened when Fin and Shon were in police custody?"

"They had sex in the cell!" Kenya exclaims.
"That's pretty fucked up, considering you two were both arrested for it."
"Yeah, well it wasn't really our fault! It was Shon who did it!" Kenya insists.
hahahahaha yes
I am going to save and publish this story, so I can actually just send Nick the URL for the whole thing tomorrow
this is so dramatic
> Tell Fin "Do you, Kenya, and Shon want some alone time to figure things out? Maybe you can convince her not to press charges for the gang banging and all."

Fin nods and agrees.

Kenya seems happy about this idea, but Fin is still very upset.

"Why am I so sad? Did you guys fuck each other while I was gone?" Fin asks.
"Well no..." Kenya admits.
Hahahah
upset it happend or upset he was caught?
like
upset about it
> Try to calm everyone down. Say "Fin is going to jail anyways, so he will get what he deserves. Let's just play board games one last time. Just like old times."

You all sit down and relax. Fin is obviously upset about what happened between him and Kenya, but he doesn't seem to care too much about you.

"So...what do you guys want to play?" You ask Fin.
"I don't know yet," Fin says.
I would be frightend
he then kicks me back
now THAT is how you intimidate someone
a monster
your a god
and you just *laugh it off*
full on kick to the nuts
hAHAHAHA
hahahahaha
> !Brianna storms into the room, angry at Fin for what he did to Kenya. She attempts to suplex him, flipping him onto the ground.

You rush over to Fin and attempt to kick him in the balls. Fin does nothing except laugh.

"Ha ha! You think you can do that?" Fin laughs as he kicks you in the nuts.

"What are you doing?! This isn't funny!"
fighting myself
I am uh
but with Kenya, Shon, and Fin
this is like a high-school drama soap opera
MAKE ME SUPLEX YOU
make me supplex you
> See is Kenya is okay

You go to Kenya's room and check if she's okay. Sure enough, she is fine.

She was right; Fin did have a crush on her.
carbon monoxid poisoning
im sad now
i-
wha
You cry yourself to sleep and dreamt that Kenya was still alive. She was sitting next to you on the couch when you woke up.

"Hey, I'm so glad you're awake! We've been waiting for you!" Fin said excitedly.

> Tell Fin "You have? What's up? Why were you waiting for me? I thought you and Shon were going to jail for gang-banging Kenya?"

"Oh yeah, we got caught and pled guilty. That's why I was here."

Fin smiles at your comment and tells you that he'll call you back later. He then goes to answer his phone.

You hang up the phone and start crying again.
I think the story is dead though, the AI can't keep track of what is going on anymore
Im on the edge of my seat
This is keeping me so entertained
this is a true crime documentary
without me even knowing!
how did we do this
fin
oh god
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A WHILE
WHAT
> !Brianna phones the police, since Kenya is her cat and therefor could not consent to sex

Brianna calls the police and reports that Kenya is being gang-banged by several men. They apparently have been doing this for quite awhile now. When they get caught, they will most likely plead guilty and be sentenced to a few years in prison or worse.
you must pay for your crimes
You guys are criminals now
Ill make brianna phone the police
Poor lump 😢
She is getting tag teamed
its no longer me, now its fin
"He's fucking Kenya!" Fin exclaims.

> Take a picture of the heinous crime and report it to the authorities. Beastiality is no joke.

Fin takes the photo of Kenya and hands it to you. You put it in your pocket and leave the house.

As you walk home, you realize that Fin probably had a crush on Kenya since she was born, but never acted upon it because he thought she was just another pretty face.
Uhh
MAKE ME CALL THE POLICE
CALL THE POLICE
FINN
im calling the police
illegal

> "Please tell me who Shon is having sex with"

"He's fucking Kenya!" Fin exclaims.
Kenny
Kennh
> Ask "Who is Shon having sex with?"

"Shon is having sex with..." Fin trails off.

"Is it Kenny?" you ask.

Fin looks surprised by your question. "No, he's not."

You look around the room and notice that everyone else has stopped playing their video games.
hm
i-
😢
Just Shon by himself?
> Ask "Who is having sex?"

"That's what they're doing," Fin answers.

"But who is having sex?"

Fin sighs and says "I think it's... uh... Shon."

You look around the room and notice that everyone else has stopped playing their video games.
OH NO
Whoooo?....
> Join them playing video games

You join the others in playing video games. It's fun and relaxing. Eventually you hear noises coming from upstairs, which turns out to be Fin and Shon talking about something.

"What's going on downstairs?" you ask.
"It sounds like they're having sex,"
Kenya, Kenzie, Kenny
noo biggy
oh no its bugging out
Hahahahah
> Throw Biggy into the fire

You throw Biggy into the fire. His charred remains lie near the fireplace.
I did this just to test
"Kenny, why don't you take her outside and feed her while I finish up here," Fin suggests.

> Feed her inside instead and start a conversation with Shon

You go into the kitchen and find Kenny the cat laying on his stomach eating a treat. He seems happy to eat, but doesn't seem particularly hungry either.

"Kenya, why don't you take Kenzie outside and give her some food while I finish up here," Fin suggests.
the AI had an aneurysm
Guys
U PUT KENYA IN THE FIREPLACE
WHAT
I
the same response every time!
D
U
YO
Hahahahah
It needed a refresh after all the chaos
> Burn Fin's corpse.

You put Fin's corpse in the fireplace and set it alight. The flames consume him completely.

> Throw Kenya into the fire

You throw Kenya into the fire. His charred remains lie near the fireplace.

> Throw Nick into the fire

You throw Nick into the fire. His charred remains lie near the fireplace.

> Throw Brianna into the fire

You throw Brianna into the fire. Her charred remains lie near the fireplace.
I am Kenny now
Nick and Brianna laugh at Fin's words. "Oh come on, its only fair," Nick says.

> Grab a beer out of Nick and Brianna's fridge. Sit back down at the table and continue the board game

You grab a beer out of Nick and Brianna's fridge. You sit back down at the table and continue the board game.

The game goes on for hours, but eventually one side or the other wins.

> Find kenya the cat and see if she would like some treats or pets

You go into the kitchen and find Kenya the cat lying on her belly eating a treat. She doesn't seem to be hungry though.

"Kenny, why don't you take her outside and feed her while I finish up here," Fin suggests.
thats disturbing
It made you crazy
WHat
HAHH
yea
It was so normal but then I just randomly point a gun at you
Fin's death causes you to collapse onto the ground. You begin laughing uncontrollably as you laugh until tears run down your cheeks.
IMEDIETLY after tho
This is so funny lol
So I killed you?
Hahahah
its so confused haha
then they die instead
and
it switches you to one of the bystandards
if YOU die
the game CANNOT tell the difference with who is dying
I have noticed
> "Fin! What are you doing!"

You yell at Fin. "Stop! Stop right now!"

Fin stops shooting and turns around to face you. He stares into your eyes as he whispers something in your ear. You don't understand what he just said but Fin pulls out the gun and points it at you.

> "What are you doing shooting a gun! Stop Fin!"

You shout at Fin. "Don't shoot!"

Fin steps closer to you and fires the gun several times into your body. You fall backwards on the floor, dead.
you let out your inner murderer
then
we were just talking
Uh oh
wHAT
> "How is everyone"

You speak to everyone briefly before turning your attention back to the others.

"Good, how is everybody?" you ask. Everyone speaks at once and answers quickly.

Nick: "Oh, everything's fine here.

> Look for Kenya

You look around and see nobody around so you walk towards the door. Suddenly, you feel a hand grab your wrist.

"Wait! What are you doing?" Kenya exclaims.

You turn around and see Fin standing there holding a gun to your head.
Nick has no idea what dimension he is in, let alone the current game
Nick is so clueless lol
> I tell Fin "Looking at Shon's cards! He cheated, it looks like he brought his own cards!"

You call Fin over and say "Look at these cards! Look at these cards!"

Fin looks at the cards and shakes his head. "No way. These are not Shon's."

"Then who did he cheat with?" Nick asks.
You cought yourself
> Try to sneak a peak at Shon's cards

You try to peek at Shon's cards from across the table. Nobody notices you, so you continue doing it until finally someone does notice and calls attention to it.

"Hey! What are you doing?" Fin asks.
Hahaha
I either dont know how to play the game
I brought my own pack of cards to settlers of catan
sean is challenging u
😮
> Start playing the board game called Settlers of Catan. To Shon's disliking, I place my city in a strategic location on the game board.

You look around at all the people sitting around you. Most of them are staring at you. Some of them are whispering about you behind their hands. Some of them are talking loudly about something else entirely.

> Tell them "Its your turn! Do you think you will win this board game? Settlers of Catan is my speciality!"

You shout out loud to the crowd. "Its your turn! Do you think you will win this board game? Its mine!" Everyone looks at each other, confused by what you said.

Shon sits down next to you and starts looking through his pack of cards.
that was very accurate of me
Except it thinks Fin is a different erson
Hyperrealistic scenario, AI has ascended
Your name is Fin. You are over at your friends' house. Your friends' names are Nick and Brianna. Your friend named Shon is also there. Nick and Brianna are dating. They have a cat named Kenya. You want to play some board games or dungeons and dragons. Suddenly, Kenya, the cat jumps up on the table and meows.  "What's wrong with Kenya?" you ask. "He doesn't usually do that."

"I don't know," Fin says. "It just seemed like it was time for him to jump up on the table."

> !Brianna picks up Kenya and pets her. She says "I love you my sweet baby girl"

Brianna picks up Kenya and puts her head on her shoulder. "I love you my sweet baby girl."

Fin looks at them both and then turns to you. He smiles. "Well, I guess we're going to be playing some board games now aren't we?"

> Play board games with the gang and have a blast!

You sit down at the table with the rest of the gang. The game is Settlers of Catan. It's an old favorite, but it seems like everyone has a different version of how they play it.
poor kenya
always liked people but dont have any other friends
so
> "Why did you only start talking now Kenya?"

You turn around and look at Kenya. "Why did you only start talking now Kenya?"

Kenya shrugs his shoulders. "Maybe because I've always liked people."

> "Wait-

You turn around and look at Kenya. "Wait- Why did you only start talking now Kenyan?"

Kenya shakes his head. Then he smiles. "Because I don't have any other friends."
I fucked up and this came out
not very
how smart are you kenya
that sounds like nick
> "How long have you been able to talk Kenya?"

You turn around and look at Kenya. "How long have you been able to talk Kenya?"

Kenya looks down again, then smiles. "Since I was born."

"Ohhh, that's so cool!" says Nick.
"What are you even talking about?" Look at Kenya and say "How smart are you?"

You turn around and look at Kenya. "Hey, how smart are you?"

Kenya looks down for a moment before looking up. "Not very," he says.
I like how true you are being to yourself shon
thanks
Thats really brave of you
Hahahah

Your name is Sean. You are over at your friends' house. Your friends' names are Nick and Brianna. Your friend named Fin is also there. Nick and Brianna are dating. They have a cat named Kenya. You want to play some board games or dungeons and dragons. Suddenly, Kenya, the cat jumps up on the table and meows.  "What's wrong with Kenya?" you ask. "He doesn't usually do that."

"It's just a kitten," says Nick. "I think he wants his mommy."

> pet and play with Kenya

You pick up Kenya and hold him close to you. He purrs in response. "Kitty loves you!" he says.

> yell "Holy shit you can talk"

You say "Holy shit you can talk!" as loud as you can. Everyone turns around and stares at you.

"Yeah! I know how to speak! And I'm not talking like a stupid dumb ass, but more like an intelligent smart ass!"

> Look at Nick and Brianna and say "Your cat can talk!"

You look at Nick and Brianna and say "Your cat can talk!" while holding Kenya closer to you. They both stare back at you in disbelief.

"Wow... That was pretty impressive," says Nick.

"Well, it worked," says Brianna.

> "What worked, what did you do?" 

"What worked? Well, I didn't try to kill them, I just talked to my cat."

"That's really brave of you," says Nick.

"Thanks," says Brianna.

You feed Kenya the female cat some food. She licks her lips and then she runs off to go eat. You sigh with relief as you know that this will be a peaceful day for all.

You pick up Kenya the cat. He looks very cute and cuddly. "Kenya" you say in a soothing voice, "I am going to take good care of you." Then you give him a big kiss on his head and he starts purring happily.

> find kenya the cat

Kenya the cat runs from the room and comes back carrying a small bag. He looks at Fin and says "Hello Fin, how are you?" Fin replies "How are you kitty?" Kenya says "Good, I'm good." Fin then kisses Kenya on both cheeks.

wHAT
The next day, you wake up early and go down to the basement where Fin lives with his girlfriend.

> Find Kenya the cat

Fin's girlfriend is sleeping in her bed when she hears a noise downstairs. She opens the door and sees Fin standing there holding a knife. He points the blade at her chest and yells "Get out of my house now!" Fin then walks into his bedroom and closes the door behind him.
this is fairly in character for kenya

I have taken your place Nick
> Push Kenya off the table angrily

"You're not going anywhere, you little shit! Now get outta here before I kick your ass."

 

The next day, you wake up early and go down to the basement where Fin lives with his girlfriend.

I just steal Briannas book
> Investigate the bag

You open the bag and take out a few things: A pen, pencils, a book called "How To Draw Cats" (which you don't understand), a bottle of water and some candy. You put them in your pocket.

Suddenly, you hear loud noises outside.

> 

The sounds seem to come from inside the house. You turn off the light in your room and wait for more noise to die down. When it does, you go back into your room and close the door behind you.

When you wake up again, there's no one here except yourself.
😦

> Pet Kenya

You look around for something to pet Kenya with, but you can't find anything that would be as cute as him jumping up on the table. Then, you see a small bag sitting by the door of the kitchen. It looks like it might contain something useful...

"natural causes"
> - YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -

You don't know if you're dead or alive, but whatever it is, you're tired of living in this shit hole. You take cover behind some rubble as a horde of infected come running towards you.

- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -
7 shots to the back of the head, meaning there must have been a reload
Sounds exactly like something the AI would say
manum usualy have only 6 shots

Did that just happen to you
Hahahah
"He was found dead with seven magnum rounds in the back of his skull. It was deemed he died of natural causes."
you live when you want to die, but die when you want to live
you fire several times
You walk along the shoreline until you come across a small wooden dock. There is a rowboat tied up nearby. It would be easy enough to board it and make your way to the mainland.

> pull out a shotgun and kill myself

You grab the shotgun and begin aiming at yourself. You fire several times into your chest, killing you instantly.

> paddle to the mainland

You swim towards the shoreline. You reach the shore and begin paddling toward the island. A few minutes later you hear a loud noise behind you. You turn around and see a large wave coming at you.

> Scream "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

You scream as loud as you can and try to fight the current. You manage to stay afloat, but soon you drown.

- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -

I mean I managed in the Cthulhu story remember
I knew something was wrong when I didnt get the "YOU DIED - GAME OVER"
the game wont let you die
damn it
The next day, you wake up in a bed of fresh blood. The wounds on your body heal at an incredible rate, but the pain is still there. You sit up slowly and notice that you no longer have any money in your pocket.
much easier then my try
Hahaha
You are Die, a noble living in the kingdom of Larion. You have a pouch of gold and a small dagger. You are awakened by one of your servants who tells you that your keep is under attack. You look out the window and see a large army marching towards your keep. You quickly grab your bag of gold and rush to find some place to hide.

As you run through the forest, you hear screams for help from within the village.

> Kill myself

You decide it would be best if you killed yourself rather than having the villagers find you. You take out your dagger and stab yourself in the chest several times, killing yourself instantly.
Hahahaha
4 tries
> shoot myslef

One night after dinner you walk over to the couch where you keep all your guns. You grab one of them and look at it. It's a .22LR. The only gun you own besides your trusty bat which is also a .45ACP.

"This will do nicely."

> shoot myself in the head

You quickly put the gun away and then turn around to lie down on the couch.

"Hey, can I sleep with you tonight?" you ask.
"Sure, why not?" he says as he gets up from his chair.
"Thanks.

> i pick up a gun and shoot myself in the head

You stand up slowly and then swing the door open.

"What the fuck are you doing?!"
"I'm taking a gun out of my bag so I can shoot myself in the head."
"No, don't do that!" he shouts.

> i point the gun to my head and pull the trigger

You point the gun at my head and pull the trigger.

It fires!

"Shit!" he exclaims as he rushes back into his room.
its really hard to end the story via killing yourself
9/11s
3 9/11a

I hope they all go well
You pull out your stapler and pen and begin writing furiously.

"I don't know how many more are going to happen..." You write. "But I sure hope they all go well."
a third one
lol
You wake up the next morning and turn on the TV only to find that there is nothing on except some re-runs of The Simpsons. You can't believe it!

A few hours later you hear a loud explosion outside. It sounds like a bomb went off somewhere near Ground Zero.

> I say "oh christ is it ANOTHER 9/11? How many 9/11s are there going to be?"

You say "oh christ is it another 9/11? How many 9/11s are there going to be?"

You quickly check the news again and see that someone has already reported a third one. It says that it occurred in New Jersey. You start getting concerned again...
hahah
Only to have another 9/11 happen
Oh man, I tried to see if anyone was talking about my second 9/11
lmfao
Im putting the navy seal copy pasta in as the custom adventure pompt

The pilot looks at you for a moment and then lets you fly the plane.

> I aim the plane towards the new world trade center

You aim the plane towards the World Trade Center. It seems like fate when you see it heading directly towards your target.

As soon as you release the controls, the plane goes into a steep dive and crashes into one of those buildings.
70% of the time it works every time
Hahahahah
70% of the time it works everytime
As i climbed my way onto a flying airplane
He grabs your arm and begins pulling it away from your other arm.

> I pull down my pants and show him my weeny

You pull down your pants revealing your penis and then push your dick toward the pilot.

"Look, I'm not going to hurt you!" You say. "Just let me fly this plane."

The pilot looks at you for a moment and then lets you fly the plane.

This game wont let me have consensual sex but I can slap a zombie with my schlong
***really fun!***
It was really fun!
Hahahaha holy fuck
> Slap a zombie with my schlong

You pull your arm back and slap the zombie across the face. He lets out a pained scream as you kick him in the ribs. His eyes widen in shock as he falls backwards onto the ground.

> Penetrate the zombie with my peepee

You push into the zombie and start to run through the streets. You keep running until you reach a park where you stop and stand in front of a tree. You take out your phone and begin to make a video diary about how this day went.

It was really fun!
Hahahaha
the game wont let me have consensual sex with a zombie
Sorry Brianna
> Ask the next zombie I see if he wants to have consentual sex

As you approach the next building, you notice several more bodies lying around. They look like they were killed yesterday. There is a group of five people huddled together in the corner of the room.

> Ask the next zombie I see if he wants to have consensual sex

A large black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt approaches you. He stares at you blankly as if he doesn't know who you are.

"Who are you?" You ask him.
"What? Who am I?" He asks back.
"Are these your friends?"

> Ask the next zombie I see if he wants to have consentual sex

He looks up at you and smiles. He slowly walks towards you, grabbing your hand and putting it on his shoulder. He holds it tightly as he nods his head vigorously. Then he pulls away quickly before you can react.
adventure
```"I need you to get me into that building over there, I want to see if they got any money changers or anything like that." You say pointing towards the door of the bank.
“What? No!

> I run down the street

You quickly run down the street with your stapler in hand. A few minutes later you hear some noise from inside and then suddenly a gunshot rings out followed by more gunshots.

"Shit! Shit! What the fuck?!"

> I drop to the ground

You fall to the ground clutching your head as you look up at the sky where a plane is now coming straight for you. The bullets whiz past your face and hit nearby cars causing them to explode.```
It derailed very quickly
You are a business man just trying to make it in Manhattan. You have a pen and a stapler and are setting out to do the biggest business deal of your life.
I made one

WIth exclamation marks
> !A zombie tries to have sex with me

The zombie is not going to be able to do anything to you, so it will just lie there and try to have sex with you. It has no idea what it's doing, but its too lazy or stupid for any other reason.
you can guide the story
So

"Why did you stab here?!"
"Because I've always been attracted to women with big tits."

You stab her repeatedly until she dies.

"Okay, okay, I get it. We don't really know each other too well yet." Cynthia says. "But why did you look at me like that?"

"Because I've always been attracted to women with big tits." You reply.
I didn't even do anything remotely sexual yet
I just started this story
Cynthia looks at you for awhile before speaking again.

> I say "G'day m'lady"

"Good morning," she says.

You nod back at her and continue working. A few minutes later, Cynthia notices that you're staring at her breasts. She blushes and quickly covers herself up with one hand while holding the other out to you.
lol
I just try and have romantic relationships with bones in aidungeon

I think im finally at the point where I dont see myself buying any apple products any time in the future, unless something changes
i'd say they're too focused on the professional scene but they've been doing pretty shitty in that niche as well
I wonder if Apple knew this would lose them customers
😦
3/4 of my (MAC) games
I think about 3/4 of my games have big "DO NOT TRY RUNNING THIS" warnings on steam
no game devs want to even try porting it
goodluck apple
But yeah idk what the civ devs did
There's actually a rumour Apple is making a gaming mac pro
<@!136253782131474432>  I think gaming on MacOS died
I dont think any Developers have even tried to make games compatible with Catalina
"An Unknown Error Occurred"
no games for fin
it just lost support or something
So Civ V is unplayable on Mac too
Wow
no legends englessly
😢
Fuck that includes endless legend
It cant run any 32 bit games
Lol wow <@!136253782131474432> I can barely run any games on my macbook with catalina
only 251 here 😢

nice
I'm second place for tourism for quickly gaining on the other guy
ah ok

there IS a culture victory
I dont think there is a religion victory
do you need to have your religion as the main religion in every city to win world religion
you can do it
+560 science
making 183 gold per turn
my religion is in nearly every city
+42 tourism
nice
I think I have a shot at winning
I'm doing super well in this game
i can try too
I'd be down soon
do you want to play a little bit of endless legend or civ 5?

Yes Nick!!!
I just want to swim
what the actual fuck AI
*mother*
> Swim until I can't anymore

You both slowly swim towards each other. You begin to drift apart and you begin to cry. "Why did we have to break up?" You sob.

She strokes your hair lovingly and says "I don't understand why either, but I'm sorry for breaking up with you."

> Swim out deeper into the ocean

You both sink further down into the water. You are so happy and contented that you are finally free of your relationship with your mother. The waves lap against you as they splash up against you.

Your body is warm and comfortable under the water, which makes you feel very peaceful.
uhhhhhhhhhh
https://pics.me.me/when-u-drink-water-19254581.png
We're in love
wwhy do you do this
oooohhh noooooooooo
Oh shit it's getting hot and steamy


https://i.imgur.com/45bHBQC.jpg
😢
it huryts
stop
Guys

everyday
its real life simulator
You shit your pants and pass out again.
oh noooooooo
D:
The door opens up and a tall, dark haired man walks in wearing a suit. He smiles at you and says "Hi." Then he notices your money bag on the floor behind you.

> slap him with my schlong

Slap the man with my schlong.

He looks shocked and then laughs. He starts laughing so hard he drops his suit jacket and pants, which causes you to laugh too. The man grabs your hand and begins stroking it while still laughing even harder.
Well, I suppose it's better than nothing, but I still don't feel as great as when I took the last one. The shakes are getting worse and the room is starting to look like a hurricane might hit anytime now.
I came back from the dead and am having a fucked psychedelic trip
rip bot
I broke it
> Ask "Am I Alive?"

Are you alive? Are you not? Am I dead or am I still here? Do I even exist anymore? What the fuck is going on?!

I don't understand anything. Everything around me seems to be changing all the time and I feel like something isn't right.
because I caught it on ligma
made up a word
The AI
what is going on!
thats not even a word!
What's ligma?

> ligma balls

Liguosity Balls.
You suck.
- YOU SUCK!!!GAME OVER!
you ok
"You ok."
You die peacefully.

- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -

> ok

You ok.
- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -
YOU ARE NOW IN THE LIGHT OF DARKNESS! YOUR LIFE IS ENDING HERE AND NO ONE CAN HELP YOU ANYMORE!

- YOU DIED! GAME OVER! -
so the game is getting sassy
so it wont forget
maybe it pings things as important
oit can remebger
neeto
You ask about the news. A minion answers: "The Elder Things are winning, but we've been fighting them off for years now. We think that they will eventually win, but then they always do."
this is like 10 back and forths later:
holy shit I did not think it would remember what I was doing
https://media.makeameme.org/created/thomas-had-never-618a9ef63a.jpg
Shon I think youve been replaced
> Command the elder things and minions to open portals and begin a siege on Earth

You command the elder things and minions to open portals and begin a siege on Earth. The battle for Earth begins.
hahaha
you DID spend like, 4 years with the necronomicon tho
for context: this is the mystery setting and I am a simple detective from Chicago P.D.
BY the way
> Is Cthulu dead?

No, he isn't dead. He has merely become one with the world. Your actions have caused him to lose control over himself and become one with the world.

> Take his place on his throne

You take his place on his throne. You now rule the land as its new ruler.
"i am cuthulu
throne
now I took his place on his thron
oh no
i said "find and kill the servants" and it killed him instead
oh
killed him
i uh
yes
Good thing I have a book on zombie survival
> Ask Cthulu "What is my first task as your servant?"

"Well, you're going to need to kill all the other servants before you can take your place. But why should that be difficult? They aren't even human anymore; they're just zombies or something."
u did it
> Enthusiastically continue the ritual and summon Cthulu

You eagerly begin chanting 'Cthulhu fhtagn' as loudly as you can. Suddenly a black cloud appears above you and you feel yourself being sucked into it.

> Embrace the cloud and enter the portal to see the great lord, Cthulu

You embrace the cloud and enter the portal to see Cthulu. He looks down upon you from some sort of throne made out of skulls.

 
"Ah, mortal," he says "I've been expecting you.
lol
I spealt cthulhu wrong lmfa
its happenning
Shon
> Read The Necronomicon and attempt to summon the great lord, Cthulu

You read The Necronomicon and try to summon Cthulhu, but fail. You then decide to try summoning Cthulu instead. You open up a portal to hell and chant 'Cthulhu fhtagn' as loud as you can.
four years with the necronomicon
I think I know where the zombie apocolips started
hum
> Go back to the library and see if they have The Necronomicon

You return to the library and look through their bookshelves again. This time they have a copy of The Necronomicon which seems very useful. You grab it and leave the library.

 
Four years pass...
oh my god shon
More time keeps passing
> Go to the library and see if they have the enchiridion

You head to the library and look through their bookshelf. There isn't any, but you do find an old book called 'How To Survive In A Zombie Apocalypse'. It seems like it would help you when things get really bad, so you grab it.

 
Three months pass...
yeah lol
usualy for bodies
when they have an unidentfied person they are a john doe
its also the standard name for "we dont know his name" used by like, military and police
I like how his name is the same as the guy I shot in the cave
ohhhhh
or maybe it meant "You didnt know his last name"
lmao
Maybe doe is his middle name
but you dont know his last name
uh oh*
You check the news on your phone and see that another one has happened. A man was killed by police officers in front of his wife and children. His name is John Doe, he lives near you, but you don't know his last name.

 
A week passes...
uh ok
i think the AI had a stronk
IM less impressed now
Uhhhhhhh
"I just killed a man chief"
"Mondays, eh?"
You guys should try this game
I like how uninterested he seemed
You tell the chief "The criminal is dead, you'll find his body at the cave. I had to shoot him in self defence." The chief nods and leaves without saying anything else.

 
Two days pass...
maybe
I mean it also remembered the altercation at the cave i think because it said they would send someone over
can probobly only remeber 1-2 back
so it can remeber at least the past few lines
> Tell them "Lets tell police headquarters about this, we have a lot of paperwork to do"

You tell them "Lets tell police headquarters about this, we have a lot of paperwork to do." They nod and start walking off.

> Follow them to the car and hop in the driver's seat

You follow them to the car and hop in the driver's seat. You drive off towards police headquarters.

 
A few hours later...
Your partner arrives at police headquarters and tells you that they'll send someone over right away. You go inside where you see several people waiting for you.
but look:
I thought that this game had no short term memory
im actually kind of impressed
okay guys wow
This is like that rick and morty episode where side characters keep appearing
awkwardly
jim just watched the whole thng unfold
lol
I have a *partner*???
You tell the woman "It's alright, he can't hurt anyone anymore." She wipes her eyes and smiles.

"Thank you so much!" she says.

You turn to your partner who is still standing nearby. He doesn't seem surprised by all this.
hahah wtf
she loved that man
uhhhhh
You shout "I am Detective Jimbo, I just shot a known criminal back in that cave! Who are you?"

She turns around and looks at you. Her eyes widen and she runs forward with tears streaming down her face. She hugs you tightly while sobbing uncontrollably.
I am the police!
Why am I all of a sudden the criminal?
where did she come from?
who is she?
What
> From his name in his wallet, was this the criminal I was looking for?

You read the contents of his wallet and they match what you were looking for:

Name: John Doe
Address: 1145 W.

> Search for an exit to the cave

You walk out of the cave into a larger open space with trees surrounding you.

"Where are we going?" you ask.
"We're going to get away from here," she replies. "The police will be coming soon."
also:
oh cool
its free rn
I told you about it before nick said it was a lot of fun
https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/sundered-eldritch-edition/home
Hey @everyone this game is free
🤔🤔🤔
"I tell the man I will shoot if he gets closer"
"You fire six times in the man as he pleads for his life"
"dm wtf thats not what I said"
"too late"
lol why did it shoot him while he was surrendering
oh no
You are Jimbo, a detective living in Chicago. You have a pistol and a police badge. You enter the forest where you believe the criminal you're searching for fled to. Suddenly , you hear a gunshot from behind you.

"What the fuck?" you say as you turn around. "Who's there?"

The man who shot at you is standing behind a tree with his back turned to you.

> Get behind cover and try to sneak up on the man

You crawl behind some trees and wait for him to come closer. He doesn't though so you decide that he must be hiding somewhere else. You start sneaking towards the direction of the sound but suddenly your foot slips off a root and you fall into a hole in the ground.

> Turn on flashlight and see if there is a way out of the hole

You turn on the light and shine it down the hole you fell through. It seems like it leads to a small cave but then again maybe not. The flashlight beam illuminates the darkness below and reveals a large opening just big enough for you to squeeze through.

> Escape the cave through the opening and search for the man who shot at me

You climb down the opening and continue searching for the man who shot at you. You find him about halfway through a tunnel which looks like it goes all the way to another cave entrance.

"Hey, I found you!" he says.

> I aim my gun at him and shout "Shut up! Get on the ground!"

You point your gun at him and fire. He falls backwards and drops his weapon.

"I'm sorry," he says. "It was an accident."

> Yell "Get on the ground now or I will shoot!"

He gets on the ground immediately and you take advantage of this opportunity by shooting him in the head. His body lies motionless on the floor of the cave.

You look around and notice that your flashlight has been destroyed.
did you feel pain
the game made me shoot someone
Oh my god
oh boy
and "went to the basement" to look for her father
then a girl showed up behind me
I was in the forest looking for a criminal
im so confused
the NPC thinks he is me
omg
Haha

At least the gummie bears in the giant tigar at renfrew are amazing
Giant Tiger for some reason, I cannot explain it, are great
and
I love my gummies

they are very hard
lol
for three years
i've had some in my closet at home
and REALLY juciy

now I need to try them
you've hyped me up
I had some when I went home
Hahaha
like unbelivibly good
but they are *fucking delicious*
they sell identicle packaging and bears
Giant tiger
I cant understand why
but for some reason
but not *great*

You guys know that large circule tub of gummie bears you can get like, any large store?
tru
Hr*
He
$200/he
But that's like
the cord probably costs $12
In reality im probably paying 99% for labour costs for the poor technician to open up my macbook
That's awful
same tech i guess though
cable
different flex xable
Wow
https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18271733/flexgate-display-problem-macbook-pro-apple
flex cord
Which is weird :/
Cheaper than a new laptop keyboard internal power cord
So not even that much
nice
Yeah
$95
Only $90 actually
$100 for 2x8?
Oh $200 for 2x16
Was that around $200
Damn it RHEA
Also I should have the money to buy whatever amount I feel
That's another reason I went for this
I can't even remember tbh
taking up all the slots
My work computer has 32 and I love it
oh is your current RAM two sticks of 4GB though
Haha I just got a kit that came with two
24GB seems overkill is what i mean hehe
Yeah but 16GB seems good
Running a few VMs compiling huge programs
8GB hasn't been enough for the work I have to do honestly
thats overkill isnt it? you already have 8GB
To go with my 8gb already installed
16 ddr4
8GB DDR4?
So I bought ram
:I
I'm upset
Hr never responded
$2k
when you getting your $200
cold
The backdoor on this 88 is stuck a bit open
That's entirely retarded
Wat
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-diego-school-district-sues-electronic-cigarette-maker-juul/
Yeah... A lot of the Canadians were dual citizens in Iran too so it was a lot of Iranians they killed
well either way they dont want to be seen as responsible for the deaths of their own citizens on board
Iran was pretty obviously trying to cover up a massive fuck uo
That could be true but Iran said it was a mechanical failure like an hour after it happened which is impossibly quick
something they would obviously never report on
that, or the US operatives involved in the assassination of the general were using it to get back to Canada
missile heat signatures
Being on high alert
I definitely think it was an accident by Iran
Yeah I figured
not mechanical
so the plane above iran may have been shot down
It's very cute
sounds like animal crossing
wow nice

A nice play is a hill with no recorces

i like babies because their tumbies are big
With all the expansions there is the following:
Time Victory, AKA the "JUST LET THE GAME END ALREADY" where the civ with the most points wins by default
Elimination Victory, AKA the "Fastest and most common victory" where you kill everyone.
Domination Victory, AKA the "I could have gone for elimination" where you capture every capital
Science Victory, AKA the "Build the spaceship" where you also need a lot of production
Culture Victory, AKA the "So much god damn tourism" where you just kinda randomly win if you are ahead
aww
no i dont rn
and the wonders that give you extra votes
do u have any pictures
it can work if you have enough city state support
stumbling around

findlay i wanted 2 kno
or is culture the same as tourism victory in BNW
time, science, culture, domination, tourism?
hello findlay
What kind of victories are there btw
Haha
they have a soft spot for me for religious fanatisism
that is good too
they dont have a passive tho
if they dont get a religion
this also means
Byzantium is interesting because unlike all other races, they get a bonus belief (which are REALLY strong) when they make a religion
which is pretty good
etc
2x uranium
2x iron
2x hourses
so like
Russia gets double stratigic recorces
I know also
yea
thats an entire tree for free
that's a whole chain of policies
that's quite a lot
it might only sound like ~5 free policies but
oh damn I didn't know that
its the best 'general' civ
poland, the free social policy is actualy huge
theere are other really strong ones like

Nw all you need to do is git add index.html
how do i do that again
nick now if i wanna send my updated document to git
Git remote delete origin or something
I think
Oh haha
ahh its doing the wrong thingy suddenly
[master]Brianna - git push origin master
fatal: '/Brianna.github.xlm' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.
ok!
And you're done
Now git push origin master
Hahaha perfect
[master] ~= Brianna - 
git commit -m "I dont really understand what I'm doing"
[master (root-commit) ad3ee67] I dont really understand what I'm doing
 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
Or it might want git commit -m then the message
Now git commit 'some message that describes what you're doinf'
so why do 404!!
Yes!
so it LOOKS to me like everything should be working right?
Ok! Good
master] ~= Brianna - git status    [~/D/M/R/Responsive web 2]

Type git status
nnnothing from what i can tell
Yes
git add *?
What happens if you type git add *
404!
and still!
but i refresh
Oh ok cool!
ok so i am already taking from that origin apparently
All of that
https://github.com/briannamegrath/briannamegrath.github.io.git
Haha
Oh no sorry
i dont know her
i have never been in contact with brianna.github.xlm
i am confus
like /Brianna.github.xlm?
wait do i write it exactly as you have?
Then if that's happy then you can run the other commands!
oh ok
/Brianna.github.xlm
ah
/brianna
GitHub.com
Other one
so thats my brianna.github.io
The one you sent earlier
Not the webpage but the normal GitHub linn
Git remote add origin (url of your GitHub.com repo)
Brianna - git init              [~/D/M/R/Responsive web 2] 128
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/Brianna/Desktop/MediaDesign/Responsive Web Design/Responsive web 2/.git/
Type git init
how do i make him happy
i thought it was happy
oh no!
Oh it's not happy
hahahaha
Brianna - git add -- index.html     [~/D/M/R/Responsive web 2]
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Brianna - git commit -m "i made index.html"
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Brianna - git push origin master
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

Brianna -
I like that image
Hahahaga
so i am confused
What was the output from the commands
the terminal looks happy with what im feeding it
Hmm
still got a 404 for some reason
ooook
Git push origin master
Git commit -m "I made index.html"
i still get 404 :0
now...... what
i did it
ok 😮
Haha try git add index.html
i just made her
she is there
yes yes
Index.html
with which files would live
and also i forgot to make a folder
oh noo
This usually doesn't happen
I'm stuck in traffic on my ride home
Is there files in the folder
but i forgot to do something with a folder..
i think it did
Oh! It should have uploaded to GitHub
yes!
Did you do git add, git commit and git push
oh! well i have to make a little html5 thing
The tell us empty
You haven't pushed your code yet!
Yes it is
cat
haha my little octoca
https://github.com/briannamegrath/briannamegrath.github.io
also i can see i think a pages?
terminal is terminal
it obviously has to be right
is the terminal in vsc the same as iterm
one question
WAIT
If you go to your account
On GitHub.com
uuuuuhhh
Is your code online? Can you see it
oh no
Ive actually never used GitHub pages
Hmmm
i get a 404
but i cannot
im supposed to be able to find my page by just doing briannamegrath.github.io
and APPARENTLY
Yes
and did some stuff in the terminal
Oh yes
a github repository
i made
so!!

thats fucked that thats what you have to do to be a successful influencer, be plastic and put peoples lives in danger
Drake's fucked for putting her on his video
she was a nobody before
the only reason she is known and an influencer is -because- she threw the chair
Oh no what why
tsumugi**
my teacher made me change my tsumg
theyre stripper lashes baybeee
it looks like she has like, 2 stacked
i think she is really pretty but her lashes are too think
:I
Views I guess
whyyyyy
She threw it off her apartment balcony onto a busy high way
still tho why did she throw,,, a chair
she just an influencer , i think all she has is lip fillers actually
Oh yeah there's a million filters and a ton of makeup
she looks plastic
Also people like chair girl simply because she's hot
<:Disgust:645731276426313739>

Shon this chat is for big word bois only sorry
12:01 and no money :-(
And not like this
<:smile:662080655097856040>
I like it when people are like this
And same shon
You'd think people so knowledgable about the environment would want to see it survive
sometimes its more often "getting around" than following
I just like it when people are happy. Why are people not happy with each other
A lot of the jobs for people in my program unfortunately come from provate sector companies needing people to help them follow, or get around environmental laws and standards
That is really sad
Had a guy that was like "Environmental scientists must serve the coorporations to pass stupid government hurdles"
My profs sometimes made jokes about the far right and trump
Had a guy who was like "I beleive in the oil sands and clean coal"
I had a prof who was a climate change denier teaching climate science
Really? That's really strange
Maddening
None of my CS class was
(alright actually a surprisingly high amount)
what percentage of my class of enviro kids will be conservative right?
chat rooms, uni classes
Yeah
hard to surround yourself with those of differing views
And even friend groups
Like Facebook
But unfortunately people fall into echo chambers
Yeah I definitely try to
You should give every part considerable thought
Question everything, always
You shouldnt be completely rooted into one side
Ah, yeah I agree
and that requires being in a way, apolitical, ideologically neutral, or centrist, in one area of your life
Saying it is important to separate yourself from your values and ideology, or at least understand their impacts and biasses on how you view things when consuming media, digesting information, or conducting research
and that of the society
important to distinguish with the ideology that belongs to an individual
No
Like when dealing with facts and information?
Are you saying government sectors should be apolitical
Also I might just be a bit tired but I'm having trouble understanding what you mean
oh no
I think my blue light filter causes it
God damnit 3a
Hahahaha
Phone restarted again. I was going to say the contrast of the seriousness and sophisticated ness of this conversation and your name being peepeepoopoo man is absolutely hilarious
and that requires discourse and skeptisim of all thing across all ideologies
science and progress only ever occurs from questioning past establishments and norms and pushing forward concepts through disproving supporting or non-supporting facts, thus supporting or weakening standpoints
needs to remain ideologically seperate or cenrist, or just apolitical really, if thats even possible
Information management and research infact
information management is the only domain where it makes much much more sense to remain skeptical of everything on all sides, and ideologically neutral (in other words centrist) I dont think it makes sense in any other public or private policy sector though
Canada needs a reform otherwise we will become the USA
More parties the better too
Yeah
without the integration of values
It all comes down to who uses and presents the facts the best
Toronto star is a bit bad for it
Oh yeah
wing
Left-skewed media can actually be dangerously biased, same as right wind
Oh nice! I would still recommend it. It's not too common and definitely a software issue that will be fixed
today
Annie just bought one
oh noo
the healthiest thing about a centrist government is keeping radical misinformation in check. Left wing govs usually do that too in most cases though. But I much much rather digest centrist media for non-biased evidence based information than left or rigth skewing sources. CBC is actually centre media. Blogs like the Narwhal are left
Also fucking 3a randomly reboots
Definitely
but Liberal is about 1000x better than conservative still
I am green / NDP all the way
Where you're claiming to be in between a corrupt party and one trying to fix the world dying
Capitalism is just a device to leverage productivity off of those who seek self-interest, where as communism leverages productivity from altruists. They tools are only as effective as the ideological base upon which they are applied
I don't think centerism as a concept is wrong, I just think anybody claiming to be one in this climate is stupid
When each side is true to what they're supposed to be yeah
healthy
I used to think about the center that way, and it makes sense ideologically. being ideologically center is stupid. BUt a society being center as an amalgamation of many people can actually be kinda health
I guess the Canadian liberals would be a centerist party
As a concept it exists
I used to think like that
and sorta but i wouldnt view it that way fully
It sounds very intellectual
It's a good phrase
Hahaha
i used 'incendiary tripe' in a paper this year lol
There are no real conservative parties
Tbh centerist people are just closet right wing people in this age imo
Incinirary
tripe:
2.
INFORMAL
nonsense; rubbish.
"you do talk tripe sometimes"
Ah yeah
incindiary: 2.
tending to stir up conflict.
"incendiary rhetoric"
I think I understand what you mean
but they are perfect
Yeah true
i had to
google those words if you must
too provocative
yeah but i like to see it from a centrist description, not the raw incindiary tripe itself
No matter what trump does, they're all for it
Nothing phases then
I like to see how they spin things
not worth it
And angry
And it makes me sad
Sometimes I do just to see it
or whatever chan is still alive
Fuck no
dont venture onto the donald though
thats nice
Saying they want each other to be safe
era of war propoganda is over sorta
I've seen Americans talking to Iranians on Reddit
yeah true
But yeah
Well, one form of it
the era of propoganda is over
same i dont think much of our generation will after all our non glorified media
Would rather hide or shoot myself than get drafted
Man I've kind of decided that I will never fight in a war

Lmao
u should buy a car with it
lol
I'm so close
I'm staying up until 12 to see it lmai
u get first paycheck yet
11pm ish to 6:30
we ended our endless legend game like 1 1/2 hours before that
Ive been waking up at around 6:30am
Lol
rip
i did not
if you fell asleep imedietly
4 hour sleep ish
i feel pain reading that
i had to wake up at 9am which was awful
yeahhh
after last night
its fuk'd
shon
how is your sleep schedule shehn
ah I see
i need to apply for job and masters at the moment anyways so my abscence is timed well
yes
so we may become legends endlessly
eventualy
you must return fin
while the parents journey to ottawa in search of meagre funds to exchange for food and services

why do you abandon us
fin why
😢
puppy litter
im stuck in renfrew looking after the animals
i will be gon
like thursday or something
I really want to have game night at nicks place
i am good for endless
if i was in ottawa then all i would do is play strategy games
https://i.imgur.com/zBS4UP5.jpg
oh no
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-nuNkEnH40
put the frew in your rear view, 
leave that place at a steady pace,
Come back to ottawa, akunamatata.
nah who wants to be there?
the frew aint fun
yea man its better here
come back to ottawa
aw man
did not know you were in the frew
kille me
left with satellite
oh
the mobile network wont work for some reason
for christ sakes
Renfrew
where are you
its agony
huh
jesus christ
by these internet speeds
im am so saddened
currently in ww2
so you can ignore non-war tech because youll get it for free
whenever they take a city from a civ for the first time, they get a free tech from that civ
also Assyria is a great for early war
basically
yes
englend said as you were squashed under her boot
"Oh look, the pest is revolting"
lol rip
England has taken out half my army in one turn
Went to war
I'm fucked lmao
ooooook
lol
I'm fucked
lol england has SAM units right up against my riflemen
I hate zulu
steamroll
they just kinda
zulu is -really- good at cheating out an early win
rome is good for expanding quickly from what I can tell
I can definitely see how zulu can go for an instant war victory
there is also one civ that gets science whenever they take a city
if you want to go for early game war victory, where science does not matter, rome and huns and zulu and some others are great
I gotta focus more on science
I think i've figured out a lot later into this game
I think i'm getting better
it happens
yea sounds like you lost that one
lol
I just wanna survive until 2500 lol
I don't expect to win myself
they just need one more city influence
yeah the netherlands are also about to get a culture victory
If she manages to build all (3-5? forget amount) of space parts, she wins
you have to fight her right now
oh
elizabeth just finished the apollo program
You can recover from a single low teir nuke, but an advanced nuke will lose you the game if you were on even fotting with them
yeah so it's endgame basically
jesus christ
and destroying like 15 or so tiles of work around impact
like 75% reduction to population and 50% of all buildings lost
they level cities
and you DO NOT want to be hit by one of those
considering the tech difference, by the time you unlock basic nukes, they have the good nukes
but
The first nuke is not nearly as powerful as later nukes
lmao
all destroyed
I pulled up with a sub, nuked them
in his harbor ready to stike
15~ massive battleships
had like
he was england
Remeber that time I nukes your navy <@!331154975457673228>
or DECAMATE an entire army
a single nuke can RUIN a city
damn
you basicly have to wait until you have nukes
if they get nukes
but yea
18 happiness
And i'm pretty stable rn
I do have a lot of cities
true
if you have more cities or better cities you might be able ot out produce them
more units will overpower stronger ones
hum
so i'm probably riped
While I have rifle men
So they have tanks and stuff
But i'm only just going through the industrial era and they've finished the modern era
you really dont want them to get a nuke
not yet
do they have a nuke?
well
not to sidetrack from the board games topic too much but should I attack first if I got told they were about to attack. Or should I wait and build up units
where they are all powerful
there is that small time frame
there is always that moment of dread when somone gets nukes first
oh boy
probably gunna rip
it's like 3 super powers against one nuke state
polynesia and netherlands will join me in 10 turns
shon i'm about to go to war with england in my civ5 game
nop
Like a super advanced risk
do you win if you get nuke
that looks really cool

wow
the board
axis vs allies takes up an entire ping pong table
maybe thursadayu
I want to play some of nicks game
sounds fun
takes hours
its the entire outcome of world war two in your hands
Axis vs Allies is strategy on crack
I love stratagy
Im excited
I know!
Axis vs Allies this morning
nick got endless legends
Civ the other day
Endless Legend last night
Diplomacy last week (almost won)
no
I have played too many strategy games
Hello
Nice ok
gunna have food too
sounds good to me! I may be a bit longer though actually
Kinda like fin did in civ other day
But yea in like 15 mins or so I can watch if you are streaming and help you figure it out
Haha alright
you will get used to it
lol thats fine
the problem is i'm not even that good at civ lmao
its a little daunting at frist but once you get into it its not so bad
more in depth
it seems like a more detailed civ
it's very similar to civ in some ways
need to fuud then I can jump into a stream
a bit
I can help in like
hah
I am intimated *in* the tutorial
I think there is a tutorial
o boi I am intimated by this game already
yeah that makes sense
oooh nice
It’s a product series. Think of the reverse: on turn 1 the chance the machine survives is .99, turn 2 = .98, turn 3 = .97, etc... You can generalize: turn x = (1-x/100).

Now we take the product of (1-x/100) from x=1 to x=100. If you can imagine, it gets small very quickly. .5 is crossed between 11 and 12 uses, so on average the machine will break by the 12th day.
what is it
I see the comment
it says 1 comment but doesn't show u
*kind of*
you got a new comment on your post
with you
and will have fun playing
yess
fin and I will love yee
thank yee nick 😄
nto today but I will
I'll get ya the dlc
so there is A LOT to play with already
I know Inferno and Symbiosis are the two I dont own, all else I have
lol I see
they never replied to the last one yet
hum
I doubt they care
I just switched the refund method
does that make steam pissy
I'm not sure tbh
not like that?
so I can buy endless legend
does steam like
Oh
what does that do
what
this time back to my paypal
I cancelled my refund request and made a new one
darn
ah no its host only
to playable stuff
everyone who owns dlc chips in
or if
idk if its HOST ONLY
let me check tho cuz
ooh
we will play with ALL dlc
if you gifted me the two dlc I am missing
THEORETICLY
because I clicked refund to steam money
good call
refun yea
want steam to refund me
I just
yeah I can definitely get it
30$?
I am curious as to what the answer is
I think endless legend is like
I upvoted
Also nick
in case you want to upvote
https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/elk6be/a_chance_question/
<@!331154975457673228>
but its not 0
it might be ASTRANOMICLY small chance
whatever equation used, it only reaches 100% when you use it 100 times, that much I KNOW
<@!331154975457673228>
i'm not good with statistics
hm
your saying the mechine has a 120% chance to break on 15 uses?
does not sound right
n(n+1) / 2 is your equation
that
120%
120
which should be
it would be 15+14+13+12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1
so on attempt 15
every other one has a chance to pass
n(n+1) / 2
the only atempt that has a strait up 100% chance to fail IS the last one (100th use)
51th atempt has a 101% chance to break
I feel like you need a factorial
yeah it's not
because
that cant be right
+12
+13
+ 14
on 15th try it would have a 15% chance of breaking
I think
n + (n -1)
if n = attempt number
it'd be like
so on the 10th try it would have had a 19% chance of breaking
the bonus question is the imporant part for me
ah yeah wait
idk how to calculate it
that's fairly simple
oh
fins better than me but yes
Lets say you have a machine that has a 1% chance to break when you use it, with that % chance going up by 1% for each subsequent use; so 1% chance to break on the first use, 2% on the second, 3% on the 3rd, 4% on the 4th, etc. I want to know if there is some formula, or easy calculation, to figure out the overall chance you would be able to use the machine X amount of times. Obviously the 10th use has a 10% chance to break, but there was also a chance to break for each previous use as well, and I am unsure how to calculate it easily.
Also, bonus question, what is the expected or average amount of uses you will get from the machine before it breaks?
I had a math question
are you or fin great at math?
hey uh
its a great game
so I can buy endless legend
hah
waiting on getting my money back
Endless legends go on sale time to time
I refunded it lol
ah yea
civ6 is also stupidly expensivve
fin can vouch
fun

endless legends is amazing

Civ6 is really similar to civ5

gunna refund civ6 and get that lol
hmm
but I would like civ 6
endless legend is kinda like civ 6
gunna need you guys to all get civ6

he won't give me any cities
idk they all act like that until they lose their capital
He seems to want to go down with honour\
Haha if he'll accept that
peace treaty him and get him to give you his second last city
now for england
Fuck zulu
i was just backseat driving
Only took me 8 hours of non stop fighting
worries
no worried you had it anyways
Haha
on your capital capture
ALright thanks for the help man
but good job
I gotta go
GLORY TO ROME
GLORY OF ROME BABY
fuck Zulu
Annex that baby
you got t
BOOM
lol
library
hahaha
thought that was something else
lol
sorry
Wait
NOP
easy peezee
you got this
I think you weill
I knoww
fingers crossed you keep enough cannon power to do so
if you had musekt man there
you could have taken it this turn
until you walk into it
oh
it just keeps regening
nothing
what happens if I just get the city's health to 0?
you have nothing to walk in now
damnit
musket man pronto
next turn you could have taken it
I need something to draw away the attention
yeaaah
he is gunna start taking out your cannons now
gunan need that musekt guy back soon
definitely not lol
polynesia not pulling their weight
ah well
couldnt do much about that
rip
yeah keep pilalging if you can
dont attack with musekt until the end
this is going to be tight
its so strong
holy what the fuck
my entire game has just been a war lol
your science is so terrible
seige time baby
he a strong boi
he remains alive
noice
then fortify
pillage
WAIt
its the only unit that can take city
he will aim for your musketman again
rush a wonder?
waltz in
now BOOM
HEAL
HEAL
HEAL
you still have a good chance
but
you lost an entire turn worth of seiging
WELL
nice
fucking england
rip that musekt man
fuck
it takes an action to
isn't that how you pillage a traderoute
that unit will die now
wait
not yet
nick
dang it
next turn
nice
heal
hold position
o baby
not bad
in the trade menu
I actually have no idea
you can bribe them to
is polynesia helping
Id say your maybe one musekt man shy of a sure thing
I think discord crashed for a sec
you eneded stream
nah his economy is fucked
id wait until museket is healed
the problem is he's probably building up another army rn
better now
i lowered the fps
how bout now
i think its on my end
weird
oh shit really?
your stream is like 1 pixel rn
thats actually fucked high
yeaah it's his capital
sooooo high
but look his city is strenght 67 or some shit
you might have -just- enough
snipe dat boi lol
yee
You can take the time to wrap around to where you musket man is if you need to
5 turns worth of assault
so you need at least 5 units probably
he can take out 1 unit a turn with his city
Ok
to <2 tiles
until they can all move it at once
keep everyone >2 tiles away
dont advance yet
then coordinated assault
yeah
I need to let my guys heal
then heal up
get ur musket boy away
back
also brb
it's also painful terrain
yeah true
dont stream units
so that they all get there at the same time
the problem is he's so insanely offensive
you have to really coordinate it though
2 muskets and 4 cannons
you can take it
I think if you bring these guys in smart
yeah he's a cunt
He pillaged it
HE PILLAGE IRTS
not enough
it does
aw shit
citadel does damage does it not
so this rifleman will reheal
damnit
Because they level up so quickly
also his guys heal nearly every turn
get ahead
get even
fall behind
get ahead
this has been my entire game so far though lmao
taht rifleman about to get rekt
rip
his guys can also attack twice each
ono
oh yeah
other cannon
now
i meant this guy no
yeah that was good
Then heal
I wanted to level up then retreat
heal
yeah man this guy's army is brutal
that did a lot of dmagae
jesus
yeah, I looked up how to deal with this guy and that's what people recommended lol
horses are grat for pillage runs
lmfao england
also fuck off england
Oh I didn't know that
pillaging replenishes some health
polynesia
I mean
netherlands and rome love me
oh thank god
embargo rome failed
nobody has ever helped me
I've had these pacts the entire game
everyone has defensive pacts with me but nobody defends me
that was nice
wow
im surprised youre in the positives
it wont go past his terriroty
make sure when you make a trade
The dude keeps pillaging them
oh eyah
oh
must have been pillaged
they never run out
I mostly trade with city states
I keep making them
they must have ran out
oh
also why do you have 0 trade routes anyways
its gunna pass too
why the fuck
embargo rome
lmao what the fuck england
lmao
get some trade routes going to pay for them
He generates military quicker than me
Yeah I had quite a few but he blew them away
a musketman or two
I'm working on it
I knoww
u need a couple more units boi
there
now
lol
I lowered it for shon when he had crap internet
OH
oh damn really?
Res too low to read city names
I took that after he tried to take antium
nobamba used to be his city
We've basically been at a stalemate most of it
but i've been trying to take this city the whole game
partially mine now lmao
and he has great wall
lol
Look at my stream
I've kept spawning great generals and slowly inched my city over to right beside his lmao
I'm getting close to taking his city anyway
I said no
not worth it
wow he isnt even giving you cities
lmao
The Iklwa Bonus for Shaka is arguably the best of all the Warmonger bonuses in Civ 5 Brave New World. Even late in the game, you'll benefit from lower unit maintenance costs as units like tanks are considered melee attackers. Shaka's army is also easy to upgrade, given the reduction in XP requirements for promotions.
and he regens infantry nearly instantly
all he does is attack me
I think he is the most war monger based cib
oh yea he is
zulus is such an annoying prick
preciselyu
"Win or lose I care not. So long as you no longer exist."
I will feel accomplished if he's wiped off the earth
it's 1868 so the game is almost done
finally on the attacking side again
lol
also i've been at war with this country for 4000 years
you'd never get a C in civ5
lmao
(dreamt civ v class was a uni course)
oh
bc I ignored all the campaign stuff
I dreamt last night that I got a C in my Civ V class
I hope that's a sign we're going to get 30 seasons of big lez with quality animation
Hahah yes
The animation for the first season is pretty much the same as the big lez show
Watching the Simpsons
save some civ vibes for multiplayer
lmao
I played civ for nearly 8 hours
:/
i have a defensive pact with polynesia as well but he won't fucking help me
Like what the fuck
for some reason this guys spear men are more powerful than my muskets
His guys also seem to reheal every turn
that I can't get at
and he has like multiple great generals just hanging out
"impis"
I'm just endlessly defending myself from them
this country's guys are so fucking strong
sometimes it be like that
this entire game has been a war against this one person
And he starts prepping an army against me again
and I say fuck no
then he wants me to fight england with him
lmao we made peace
and he'll pay me for it
noww he wants peace
just made this dude's city a puppet state and he still doesn't want peace
I see ok
I think its 10-25 depending on speed
ahh
they cant make peace within x turns of starting war
even though i'm destroying their cities now
lmao I tried discussing peace and they refused
they've been denounced by england and me
you
Well I don't really trust this country at all anymore
makes other nations not like yo
ahh
warmongering basically punishes you for taking cities when peace is possible
I'm doing it anyway but doesn't seem fair
But apparently i'll get a warmongering penalty
So I figured why not attack them back?
Now I have a tonne of units and they have none
And won
So I fought back
the country just launched a full on siege against my cities
and winning lol
the warmongering thing only goes down if they are actively warring other people
I may as well take advantage of the fact that I destroyed their army
why do I get a huge warmongering thing if I attack a city of a country that was previously trying to capture me?
this motherfucker
what a bitch
now he denounced me lmao
I'm not even close to him and he's complaining i'm too close
the zulus is a cunt
You don’t even have the power to cross oceans yet
I will give your men a slap
I will starve your city
Composite
lmao
I’m excited to destroy you with my one composure bowman on your territory in our game
I bet you could handle it
while they're sidetracked
what if I attack england but on my own
I said give me ten turns to prepare
Lol then no
they didn't offer me anything
If they give u good stuff
should I declare war on england because the consul shaka of the zulus wants me to
can you look through the backup files?
I hated when my OS took up 80GB
But it’s possible?
well, it shouldn't
The backup has no system files on it does it?
What are the odds when I restore my backup it’ll get fucked again
yeah no kidding
Crazy when software issues prevent you from using the USB ports
Apparently the lady was like “it doesn’t even say anything is wrong with the logic board in my notes so that must have been a software issue
this was a vastly better outcome
I expected two outcomes: 1. They call me in and say, we can’t fix it it’s trash. Or 2. They call me in having fixed it but ask for $1200 and then when I refuse to pay it they keep it
But I honestly did not expect to get it back
Yeah 😦
niiice
100GB free on the SSD
catalina sucks
ah rip
Now I have Catalina
Flex power cable caused keyboard and trackpad issues, software everything else
that's awesome
damn man!
Apparently they replaced the flex cable and wiped it and it’s all better
Just software?
What was the problem?
no fucking way dude!
$130
MacBook is fixed
And
I was at Apple store
😦
you've been hiding most of the day
That’s sacrelige
Without me

I remember the trailer
Its a civ in 6th game
Canada isn't in civ5 but quebec city is?
oh what
APPARENTLY
"I am the one who plays musci!"
I can't play spotify whenever civ5 is running
you guys ever have the problem where civ5 somehow kills music
<:worse:662081036296912917>

I'm sad that the devs of planetside can't seem to make a good game
doesn't even make it through Q1
"PlanetSide Arena will launch out of Early Access in Q2 of 2020"
it literally just came out
rip
"PlanetSide Arena servers will be shutting down on January 10, 2020. Read our dev letter to learn more"

If u wanna Pirates or something I'm down tho
Oooh yeah :((( everyone is in bed
U bored tho Finn wanna play something or were u still wanting to party
i wish we were playing civ
Nappin on the couchhhh
Feel gooood
Hahaha I love naps
naps are bizarre
especially in the afternoon
I always feel so weird waking up in the light
😦
Because it's not dark when I wake up and I'm not like ???????
I feel like I like sleeping during the day rather than at night
I've had ones where I wake up crying ,, one where I like shot up out of bed like an anime
I watch a lot of true crime tho so
I dream about murder alot >>
They're just terrible
😦
I had one where Kenya died repeatedly the other night
I mostly always have nightmares
if its really scary i will myself awake
and about a cockroach infestation
Do you wake up from those?
dreamt about my grandpa dying last night
sometimes bad
usually
Do you have good dreams?
Damn
nop
Not even once?
Never woke up
Oh wow like
Even on 5 hours I usually wake up
so 10 hours?
i slept like 3:15am - 1pm last night
jeeez
I think
5 hours
I don't know!
whats the longest you have stayed asleeo
I wake up once an hour roughly
Like ever
My problem is I don't stay asleep
I usually end up not being tired enough to sleep again til about 10-11
Yeah!
So youre awake 7am-8am, then asleep 8am - 4pm, then awake 4pm to 3am or something
Then he gets home and I see him for a little bit then I go to work
I spend some morning with him cuz I've woken up then he leaves for work and then I get bored and fall asleep again
I try to sleep at around 11-3 but I always wake up at 4 in the morning and can't get back to sleep
do you ever overlap with nick
when do you go to bed
oh boy
4pm 😎
hahah
I'm awake but I'm always awake
I wake up at 1pm every day
Its runing my life
so bad*
also wish my sleep schedule wasnt so weak
Wish people were awake
same here!

ok ill try it out
and that does not mean just the menue music
you should always listen to a game soundtrack at least once before overwriting it
lesgo lads
its a heist / music movie
Anyways, baby driver is a heist movie based on a guy who chooses the best music for his heiets
okay so just waiting on brianna
yeas
ok you joine?
PLanetary annihlation: kinda boring tbh
I have game btw
(GEn X Radio)
Saints Row: Also amazing
Super hexagon: amazing
Kerbal: Trash
“I listen to my own music instead of game music :)”
It kinda defined my musicl interest for 2 years
Becuase
Know
You’d never even k is
life is strange: best video game soundtrack i have ever heard
of course
What if you missed the perfect one
Sea of theives: i leave it on
Fistful: no music
How many OTHER games have you missed
but my own music is also amazing
And it shows if you never hear sit
yeah youre not wrong i like it
Ftl is amazing
But
I play my own music though
In a single day
I saw you play 3 games you never even heard the soundtrack of
itd be so boring and lonely with no music
hahahaha
Disgraceful
must have disabled it day one
I didnt even know it had music
Dispicavle
That is disposable
Ftl you never even listen too
Fun
depends on the civ you play
But
Cig music so calm
the first 500 hours of in game music is enough
its pretty!
i like civ music!!!!!!!!!!!!
Minecraft is burned into my brain permanently
😠
Civ music is trash
dispicable
but you have never heard many game sountracks of stuff you have many hours in
and the restaurants dont live up to your home cooking no more
i just put everything into my liked
its like being a foody
i am a connesour
I have >30 playlists on spotify for different moods n vibes
sacrelige
changing a song before it is done is sack religious
i finished download
thats a lie
Uh
yuo have no musical atention span
and i got bored of the payday menu music
i just change ones i deem bad
its not like i never listen ever to game soundtracks
Ocean Man - Ween during Fistful of Frags
if you gave ut a listen
the game WOULd be your fave song
well maybe
there is something so satisfying about kickign ass at a game and your fav intense song is playing
90% of good video games have GREAT music to set the mood
only bad indie games do that
there is like
lol fin
if the music is just a 1 min loop of sleazy guitar riffs, then i change it
calm if ur stealthy, but lose stealth and music goes full chaos
okay thats cool
dynamic
or if somone is down
the music changes depending on if the higest it going well or not
payday is
and apply tension or relife as needed
unless the music is synced with ingame going-ons then i always have better music
music in games was selected to fit the mood and theme of what is happening
lies
because i always have better music
😠
it ruins game
why do you never listen to in game music fin
start on Neat Neat Neat or Bellbottoms
turn off ingame music

vr helmet
i'm going to buy a valve index
guys when I get my credit card paid off and have a bit of money saved
really low level
oh gotcha
which is a low level graphics library
opengl is the free cross platform alternative to directX
what does that mean opengl
I switched from RTX rendering to opengl and now I have 1000fps
oh lol
Which my GPU Doesn't have lol
it's like an upgraded quake 2 to demo RTX features
really?
WHAT
in quake 2 rtx
lmao I get 1fps
quake 2 is free
$80 for base game, $150 for full
like the equivalent of the full game
for the 'platinum edition' (same as Civ V BNW)
lmao what
Why is CIv VI $150
what about quake 2 rtx
It looks decent surpringly
https://store.steampowered.com/app/838630/Deadliest_Catch_The_Game/
oops

its on for $13
Lmao oh no
deadliest catch the game
lmao wat
:D
You can on ultra
Not bad at all
So I can still play the newest games on medium/low
Higher is more expensive and faster
The first number is the gen and the second number is always between 50-80
Haha you're a generation and two price points above that
Minimum: GTX 650
i COULD play this
lol
Although I rarely play anything
I have a need to be able to play everything
There we go
Hahaha
Recommended: GTX 1070 or equivalent
HAH
Recommended: AMD Ryzen 7
oh damn
wars
its like mass effect but star wards
oh wow its only a month old
i'm not actually sure
What is STar wars jedi fallen order
Apparently not
rockstar doesn't make good ports
the port isn't great lol
yet my PS4 can
lmfao
except on low graphics 😦
And Briannas computer with the same GPU can't play RDR2
Haha it struggled with GTAV
Maybe I should buy a AAA game to see if i can get it under 60 frames
and had the money
I just wanted to upgrade
the CPU you have is still top end
yeah
OH hh
I load into sea of theives 3 times faster than shon
Haha yeah but now i'm using a 1440p monitor
I have never played a game with less than 60fps
But the exact same price tier
It honestly holds up so well there is no need for anything better haha
it's three generations older
yes
What do I have? 770?
😮
just the gpu
it cost around $800 when I got it
and CPU
🙂
that GPU
but holy shit
RAM is throttle
I need to upgrade the ram real bad
Ryzen 2600X, Geforce GTX 1070, 8GB DDR4 ram
because i cant imagien having a better pc than this
what are your current pc specs
now i'm back to hackintosh
Eventually I switched to linux
because I couldn't stand windows any longer lol
When I first built that computer it took me around a year and a half before I ventured into hackintosh
yeaaah
im honestly just learning how to use windows for now lol
sure man! I'd definitely help you through it
i may do it in a few weeks or something
yeah good point
I'd set it up for you but tbh it'd probably be useless unless you figured it out yourself. Just so you know how to fix it whenever a random thing breaks
you kinda need both windows and mac to get by in life
yes
Some day I need either a macbook again or another tower with hackintosh on it
oh baby
hackintosh works on that computer fairly well 🙂
pales in comparison to garage band 😦
downloaded Audacity
no free DAW to use
its weird not having a mac
why did they even program it to be able to say that
What
Lmao
apparently im going to add this song in 15 mins

And history will forgeteth you

i think
I like making my people happy
any civs that squeek by with little to no need for fighting
basicly I dont like war civs
venice being the best
I love the ocean civs
hum true enough
also i like to show off that i can win with any civ so i go random a lot
i havent not played egypt in like a year
i do play egypt thpugh
you love wonder whoring :p
also why dont you play egypt
we should see how high we can get cuonting
yes
Venice The Menace
then
shall we wait for the grocery run from the other two

i think it is complicated yeah
what a steal
Only $256 for the bundle
is it as complicated as CK?
so its like crusader kings
https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/
ah ok

Empire builder
I thought its more like a city builder or something

<:best:662105751090757673>
once we are all good
im good to play now
drunk off his ass
wass the pisskey
"you will infinetly make 2 snipers, 1 rocket, 3 taneks, until end of time. They will then potrol this area once they are made"
what i liekd in PA was I could make a factory and say
but
im ready now
back with food
but i never win
Sup Com and PA are okay too
we won on Hard mode against the AIs last night
Age of Empires is the only tolerable RTS for me
they also auto target foes, and auto resource collect
br b
etc
you can auto make units, set spawn points, et
oh thats good
theres lots of auto
same with age of empires though
I hate older RTS because you cant automate anything
at least in PA you can automate everything in a couple of clicks
I suck at PA because there is so much to do that its all about APM
because its more strategy than APM
when age of empire games last an hour i do really well
yea
so if you have idle shit it matters less
civ and endless are all turn based
but we play on slower
hah yea
so i lose every time on fast setting
i hate reflex
just more stratagy less reflex
I perfer turn based over real time any day
civ is a good game
ill try to convinsce him though
he is partial to civ now
lol i see
if they dont, then we could just play endless legends bc my housemate said he wants to just wait until im done and them play age of empires lol
but I knpw brianna wants to join, not sure if nick too
once its made I can eat and play at the same time
alright food is like half way made
making my food now 🙂
my housemate wants to play
yea haha looks like civ
So Civ
so you dont die
requiers you to be on speed to dodge all the stuff
reflex game
bullet hell
its a god damn light show
awe man. Have you ever gotten to late game in it?
I'm not the biggest fan of Terraria tbh
there is a mod the makes the game friggin ***hard***
expecial if we got mods
terraria is really friggin action packed
also
payday I can but im not as up for it
I am partial to terraria or civ. Terraria is a game we would prob play several nights too when we are all up for it
https://i.imgur.com/IB0SwYM.jpg
no
yes
i thought it was card game
yes
you have star relms on pc
and wait
payday is an action game. The only problem with payday 2 is the amount of grinding
I have Star Realms
and Payday 2
Payday: The Heist
I'm good with either
2
its a different style game
do we all have payday 1 or 2?
never played payday
Modern day pirates
It's just another form of pirates
Guys
Payday
Payday
Payday
sure
Can we wait for it so Nick and I can do a few groceries?
It is a long one and I think id definitely like to play
cuz thayts a long one
ok go for it
if we play civ
i need to cook up some kraft dinner first
I can do that if everyone wants to
my housemate is down if we play civ
So far payday, terraria, and civ look like games we all share
never played it
also payday
yes
thats a fun game
do we all have Tarraria
PA
we also have endless legends but not you
dont starve together is the first
Im looking to see what games fin has and I have too
I wanna play!!!
Haha Nick and i might do a few errands actually... How long are you guys going to play
I can't Sean my throat hurts too much to scream
not a great multiplayer game tho haha
Ah-
dark soul
Truely
what if we just all played
Tf2 holds the key to my heart
Hahaha
glory days of source engine games
Finn no it's so gross
same as fistful of frags

same its downloading now
what do you even do on it anymore
i dont have that install atm but
so Gmod
your alter ego is just *obsessed* about spooking people
and you cant stop it
just crying on the inside
this is what your alter ego does
you nailed it
but you are not in control
and spooking people
boo!
and just going
i imagin you hidding behind walls
Oh noo
but
yes
by spooking i mean perhaps being a tad more evil than that
"*boo!*" "Ahh!"
A terribly adorable concept
That is
i have had nightmares where i was a monster and i couldnt control my body and i kept spooking people
i think theres like only 3 kinds of fear or something i read and one of them is the fear of not being in control
I lost my marbles and stole people's drinks and face planted
i lose everything
I do hate that I got there that was a mistake tbh
so if I lose them
and all we really have are memories
because we have a finite amount of time on this world
i never go there
yeah same shon
I never let myself get to the spins anymore
i do not like the idea of not being in control or forgetting things
I cringe too hard at anything I do when that drunk
Very but these stories sound hilarious
Are you not worried about how you spent it
Larger than I've ever lost before
I lost a very large chunk of time
I hate that I lost 2 hours of my life
MOSTLY
So much shame and embarrassment
I always hate when I get past about 3.5 drinks
Yes
want to know her
Dooo I what
Doooo you
She sounds wild
I want to know her
Like who is this woman
Ok I hear stories
Oh no
I was a single woman girls gone wild
you were like "and I oop" and looked down and you were like "this is your drink isnt it Fin"
:^)
:)
i mean yeah you took like 3 peoples drinks throughout the night lol
I probably did
I mean
Did I do that
from you sipping from my drink
glad I didnt get that
rip brianna
rained fire
Dying
Am I don't
Like
Not to interrupt but line
and then I was like " who needs an army" and turned them all on
Like oh my god
and you were like "aha" my army is far superior
My throat hurt so bad
i had them tucked in the corner and turned off so you didnt notice them
yeah boy the stress levels get high
it was a little infurating
When I spammed artillery in Sup Com 2
they need too much apm
im not actualy *that* into real time stratagie games
I will never forget the only time I have ever seen Shon rage in a game before
its like Sup Com but pioneer era
i dont have pennies
its the best game of all time
It was on sale for like pennies
+1 Gmod
SHON
yes
Never played that
+1
SHON
SHON Shon SHon SHoN SHON
Gmod
i dont have age of empires
I've
OOH
Oh no
Oh
Garry's Mod
i think we would all starve
lol
i dont think anyone is good at it
same i think shon would have to carry us on that one
I have don't starve but I'm bad at it
i can safely speak for us all

<@!257986741896609802>
good luck
III*
I'm waiting for the 88 now wish me luck
okay game options shon: Age of Empires III, Age of Empires III, Age of Empires III: Warlord, Age of Empires II: Asian Dynasties
yeah second one
60-80
Every 600-800 meters boiiyyy
Yeah that's true lmao
even the straight lines are terribble, it takes fucking forver for the 88 to get down baseline or whatever the road is, it has like 95 stops on it
But then you have to take the 88
Most of them at least
88 goes to Terry fox
Just do a straight line damn it
best resulution
Idk how the busses are so awful
Yeaaaah
but still it literally zig zags straight soutth to billings, then straight north
Me too
https://i.imgur.com/cvH3cfl.png
whatever is right north
Ah ok yeah that makes sense then
I went to Iris
straight north of baseline
Iris
Like Queensway I think
wait not tunneys
61 also stops at a few stops before Tunneys
YEP
i like how that covers like 10 extra kilometers
Going back to Tunneys is going the wrong way isn't it
5 to billings, 88 to baseline, anything to tunneys, 61 to terry fox
Lol that describes 30% of my commutes
4 busses, 2 hours
Yeah that seemed like hell
worst bus journey of my life: Elgin to Baseline, Baseline to Terry Fox

Hahaha
thats very acurate actually
yes
The more 8s the worse it is
Bus #: 888888888
It was 80 something
Ok I have no idea what bus I was on lmao
or at least i thought i did
yeah i saw it when i was at tunneys two days ago
The 86?
44% sure that is possible
right?
then take tunneys to baseline
you can take that to tunneys
But Carling can't get me to baseline at all really for some stupid reason
oh wait
ew
Then along carling
It goes from Gatineau to carling
Then yeah that's what I didn't get on but wanted to
idk wtf 86 is
85 does that
I need a bus that goes from Gatineau to Tunneys or even better, dominion
ohhh
86 was what I got on
Haha wait sorry 85 might have been what I wanted
bayshore
hello gatineau / bashore
Second time I've done thus now
I accidentally got on the 85 instead of the 86
ew
That's the worst combination
two worst bus stops: baseline, carling
I have to take line 2 to the 88
Me too
transit deadzone
I hate carling station
God it sucked
Hahaha yeah I've had one of those
actually 4
i have had 3 data entry jobs
my struggle lay in min wage data entry
Also apparently I'm at Carling not Bayview
tru
tur
I earned this pay through struggling with customer service
I worked retail more than you tho
Hahaha
2.33x what i have made all my life
However, at this moment I am broke
:I
$36*
measly $35/hour
Hahaha
Erryday

Yeaaaaaah

lots of death
3.5 hours of mob stuff
Really what happened
Sad stressful movie too
😦
To a lonely sailor
The seas are unkind
I'm all alone strugglin to survive with my loot

2 weapons > 1 instrument > telescope > compass > shovel > mug > everyelse
I go in this order
I know when I am buying equipment
or else what am i doing
i have to
like i have to look good
yes exactly
That’s how they getcha
and now my equipment doesnt match so i have to buy new equipment
You need every outfit so you can do anything
Last time I was on
Lol I did the same
spent**
i spend literally all my money on new outfits
also
I’ll rowboat Home
get a rowboat
At me parents home
I’m adrift
I don’t have me ship
>:O
and oooh
I would join but
Finreeeeee
ok
AHHHHHHHHH
FINNNNNNN
gotta find and set up mic n stuff
Like it started as a legend of Zelda 3rd person puzzles and bosses, and eventually became a top down diablo esk shooter
gunna need a few mins
as a pirate
also <@!331154975457673228>  im awaiting ur fine presence
that IS really cool 😮
But they continue the story form the last
For totally different people
Totally different genres of games
Like
Was how NONE of the games are the same style
The thing abou the darksiders game that fascinated me
Yea.
famine is cool tho
oh

Idk anything about them
Uh
They use fury
They don’t use famin
Finnaly
he is favorite
I like him
OPOOOOH
My boy Hanad is in town

He is ironically not edgy. He is a smart ass
hannad?
to meet a friend
Then there is death
where is nick going
sure
So you can’t see his face well
lol sad times
wanna place with me <@!331154975457673228>
He just wears a cowl
fuck nick is leaving
He does
okay ill join
ooh does he not have a head

He is the edgy one
This is war
ok ok thats cool
And wears a mask
He is fully clothed
oooh
Unlike all others
You never see his skin
he looks pretty healthy
hmmmm

This is Pestilence in darksiders
Also
Oh there we go
nooooooo
Image is not loading for me 😦
Yea it’s a fun one
gods of war is actually pretty cool for myths and stuff too from what ive seen
for pestilence
this is the horse

But yea called Darksiders
Sick one
It features pestalance
And finally game 4 is a dule stick diablo shooter.
it sounds sorta familiar
Game 3 is... another. More recent, idk. What’s different but I feel it’s like an exploration style, shadow of collowus o feel
hmmm
Game 2 is like an ARPG, with legend of Zelda dungeons featuring death.
Game 1 is war, and is like a beat em up game where you kill shit like god of war
The interesting thing is every game features a different hourseman and is a CONPLEATLY different style of game
It is heavy mythos with angles and demons and the end of the world 🌎
It features the 4 hoursemen
fuck you wutocoorect
DARKSIDERS
Siers
The darksiders sword
Have you heard of
poor big foot
Also
But yet
terrible
Hah
just awful
awful
oh
YESSSS PESTILENCE
I also remember killing Bigfoot in that game.
Yea it was. The zombie expansion was legit so good
but in the red dead series its the second
in the REDEMPTION series it was the first
The unloved child
Yes it’s like
yeahhhh but i dont really count it
Yea
theres revolver
There was red dead revolver
yeah
Well yes but no
red dead redemption was the first
or wait
It was legit really good
Yea. They came out with a zombie expansion
yeah yeah second one i meant
it was a really skinny sick hprse
I think in red dead 2 there was an undead expansion with them
in the first one and plague was my favorite
horses
and you got like
i think in red dead there were the 4 horsemen
yess
We gotta get back into it and board games
The concept of them comes up a lot in my dnd canpahpn we were playing 🙂
Also if you like them
So technically there are 5 riders, but 2 of them overlap depending on how you see it
i dont know why but like apocolypse caused by illness is so creepy and cool to me
LOVE that one
Yes pestilence is sickness
That comes one by one
While the old version sees them as 4 separate riders
plague is one of them right? pestilence is sick?
But the moderne version with pestilence sees them as one force traveling together
sick
i like the idea of like
It makes a little more sense then pestilence leading to war, famine, death.
oooh yeah yea
Conquest is not bad. But it leads to war. War leads to famine. And famine leads to death.
Conquest lead first, and was foreshadowing of his three brothers.
The first was, originally, Conquest.
They are all seen as evil, but in truth the first horseman was ment to be good.
But pestilence is moderne. It was not always the case.
Most people know of: Pestilencce, War, Famin, and Death.
There are 4 hoursmen, but the first is different depending on the story
They always play a major role in stuff
Well 5
Oh those 4
LAST CHANCE FOR FREE MONEY
like war famine plague
Law, justice, karma, vice, seven sins, etc
<@!331154975457673228>
i like the apocolypse ones
It comes up a lot in my dnd adventures 🙂
Btw I have like a huge love for the seven sins thenetcis
yes
i am going to draw them
Make an art of the sins
You should like
Yea. And most food sites are not social media
plus a food site would be too on  the nose
well people DO post their food a lot haha
So insta feels off a little Becuase it’s not a food site haha. But it works for over indulgence
I know I always get stuck on gluttony MUST be food, but it’s just over indulgence in anything
But you made a good point for it and pride
I felt like Reddit should have been on it but could not place it cuz twitter is just so good for Wrath
and i like it
i am in total agreement with this
What’s your thoughts Briana
Ok so I feel that list is fairly spot on
Good luck nick with keys
Our list is:
Lust - Tumblr
Envy - Facebook
Wrath - Twitter
Sloth - YouTube
Greed - Pintrest
Gluttony - Instagram
Pride - Reddit
def reddit
I need help with keys
Good idea
Also I got an ashen chest
YESSS
everyone is always right
Everyone is a master of what they talk about
oh yeah
Becuase people are so full and sure of themselves on it
That’s a good point for reddit
Our list is:
Lust - Tumblr
Envy - Facebook
Wrath - Twitter
Sloth - YouTube
Greed - Pintrest
Gluttony - Instagram
Pride - Twitch(?)
<@!331154975457673228> I just took out a skeleton boat by myself in sea of thieves. I got a ton of cool chests if you wanna join and make some monay
better than twitch even
but i think reddit could actually be pride
yes pinterest is greed
I think I’m replacing patreon so
Yea.
so greed
of pretty things
to put in your collection
well thing is your not really SELLING it as your own you just take it
While patreon you work for it
Due to stealing people’s ideas and arts to sell as your own
Pinterest over patreon for greed
I ment like
Oh
because almost every post is like, somehow often a brag
Hum
i also find it a bit prideful too tho
but you could be greedy for wanting to be karma whore on reddit
your not greedy for working for money
Yea. And also political arguments
patreon is a little on the nose
karma mining
cuz like
i JUST said that
It could be a good fit for greed. Maybe more then patreon?
I would say Reddit for Wrath if Twitter was not more prevalent.
i know theres a TON of art theft
It just does not stand out like the other ones
just like.. heres a recipe for cookies :))))
surprisingly pure
but its like
Huh
and chat and send images
It’s basicly a better google image for finding art
and follow like boards
I use it a lot for scowering for token art
you can follow people
I don’t really see how it’s a social media
what does pinterest even,,, do
Pinterest is one of the most popular but
Our list is:
Lust - Tumblr
Envy - Facebook
Wrath - Twitter
Sloth - YouTube
Greed - Patreon
Gluttony - Instagram
Pride - Twitch(?)
definately
Well tumblr is lust prob then.
the lust is VERY present
I see
its definately still there
they did but like
and everyone on there is horny on main
I just heard banned the p0rn
especially since like
they are rampant
porn bots
Lol
its still there
dont worry
oh no no
Tumblur would have been lust but didint it like, ban poorn
and i actually use tumblr
i feel like tumblr is more lustful than snapchat
Good on nick
Makes sense
nick said that
Oh for greed
GREED
PATREON
PATERON
Our list is:
Lust - Snapchat
Envy - Facebook
Wrath - Twitter
Sloth - YouTube
Greed - ?
Gluttony - Instagram
Pride - Twitch(?)
facebook, youtube, instagram, twitter, reddit, pinterest, tumblr
of the most popular social websites
Yea list time
Ok so we have
ok im gonna get a list
im not sure actually
well hm
yeah
YES
Snapchat is lust
I feel like
Ha
hahahaha
titty streamers
cuz
twitch is lust
maybe its more pride than twitch is tho
A social media and it fits sloth
YouTube is
True
its not SOCIAL MEDIA
i dont know it seems to like
hmmm
OH! Maybe amazon is greed?
Sloth could be YouTube instead of Netflix. Both fill a similar pourpose
That’s a good point
over indulgence
instagram should be gluttony
I would almost call it pride, as it creates celebrities with followers who worship them. Each channel is all about THEM
maybe
oh wait
<@!331154975457673228>
It is a major one
do we wanna include twitch?
Hum
ummm twitch?
i luv twitter
So much rage oozing form that place
Twitter is Wrath
Wrath
twitter
Yea seven sins
so what are 7 major websites
Haha next year
so there are 7 major sins
Not home. Will be home In a year
ok ok wait
<@!331154975457673228>
I can’t 😦
THIEVES
OF
insta i definately feel is pride
sea
Facebook is envy
Hum
What websites invoke what sins
insta i feel isnt like envy but more about urself
Lust, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Gluttony, Greed, and finally the greatest of all sins, Pride.
cuz like
ok ok pride
The seven sins are:
Vanity is not one of the 7 sins
INSTA IS VANITY
reddit leads to being a cynical cunt
Or invoke what sins
NO
What website lead to what sins
Hum
It is all consuming if not stoped
Sloth seems like the least deadly sin but
I am apathy incarnate
I love being a sloth tho
Facebook and Instagram lead to envy
While Netflix and other streaming websites lead to sloth
Social media leads to one of the 7 vices of man
I feel like
Only text
yes same
If somone messages me on FB I will usually awnser but I can’t see any posts on it
But I have the news feed blocked with an extension lol
and facebook only to talk to my dad sometimes
the only social media I use is reddit
See what comes form it
I think you should try just going dark on all social media for like a week
I am also almost always out of the loop but
And I *feel* happy most of the time without it
Honestly I keep hearing stories of how people just are upset and envious due to social media
I am Imune to sue petty feelings
I do not have any social media
Yeah I feel duckin awful
But I'm heavily medicated with advil
Like my tongue hurts even
Really bad sore throat
I'm sick too
I just got over one it was awful
I don’t wanna catch nicks cold
Haha

Why aren’t we doing board games rn
On ur shoulder
I'm the little devil
Thank you findlay
Yes
Should I order a pizza
At least I shouldn’t be
Nah I’m not low enough to care
Lol
He thinks his dick is so big slap him with it
Like mud
Rub it in his face
Do it
Yo Finn
Yeah I avoid it as much as possible
Like stories are just people showing filtered inaccurate representations of their lives
Social media as a whole is bad for that
Especially with my new job
Yeah I struggle with the same thing haha
Like I find myself being like “maybe I should post that I got my BSc so I can shove that in his face” then I’m like wtf those are unhealthy thoughts I’m not like that lol
I hate competitions like that
Yeeeeep
Always a pissing contest
Sorta like your family on that one side lol
Nope that would show inferiority
Yeah I found hanging around him everything was like that
Can’t laugh at other people’s jokes
It’s like he sees it as a competition for being funny
He has never once liked a meme I have sent to the insta group chat lol
It pisses me off man
Exactly
Meanwhile we are like ducking graduated higher education 4 years later lmao
Yeah exactly
Yeah he was taking moral high ground making fun of our bad high school decisions
I can't remember well but like one drink would have been fine
Yeah like fuck off obviously
Deadpan straigtface
And he sent “don’t drive home”
We made a story of us cheersing
Like when he sent that snap to us when we were at the bar
Bad*
Bas vibes man
Yeah exactly
Always has to put other people down for no reason
Yeah he definitely is
Like always on a high horse
If you know what I mean
And same about John I just feel like he is super super sanctimonious
Hell yeah
Yeah!
Haha
Will you be awake enough to play pirates tn
She slept from 11-6am then went back to sleep at 11am
Lmao
Then lay in bed watching YouTube until 4pm
Brianna is still sleeping
And lol
Slept until 1pm
John bossy is going and he annoys me so much
Then kept getting woken up by ice pellets against the window
And yeah I couldn’t all asleep until 5am
I don't blame you
I might skip out
Oh no really
Hahah
It'll be so grimy
I have been the hugest human piece of shit
But I have to
And I don't even want to go to the party lmao
Ah yeah sounds about right
Cus of freezing rain
Was supposed to go into Renfrew TN but stuck in Ottawa
I don’t think I have a way back to renfrew for axels though
Where are you at
oh hell yeah
I’m in Ottawa
Are you home fin?
Not sure why it’s free
No monopoly
And it is good if there is competition
Everyone wants in on the action
pls just use steam
through microsoft, epic, discord, whatever
jesus why does every game needs its own launcher
feels good
also this is the first time in years that I have been able to sit and game up some age of empires or whatever, even sea of thieves
like the talos principle
also how are these games just free?
lol shon that friends video
Oh no
I bought these

The only location that might have more of the dark-arts style of voodoo is a place they have avoided
I will if I find a fitting character, she gives me which doctor vibes, party has no found anyone close to that.
<@!257986741896609802>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7lPjggiV9Q
<@257986741896609802> if u ever have a character plz use mi art
Like the free games
I got totally realistic battle simulator the other day from that sale
Ah yes that is a good game
https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/the-talos-principle/home
Free for everyone
Nick another free game for your collection
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntxBa66c33M&ebc=ANyPxKpqoWB4wkXcg6AGUFtCrvmVFGvfYpGWlwFqUf2BLkHGORqnH0MVM5GKmlhsIj2DaYuWsqUP3BrUVp05zlVgAecmuRsvqQ
It’s also a good enough quality I would totally use it for a token of an NPC in my campaign, if I had a fitting character. I don’t have anyone fitting tho. But that shows you! I spend like hours looking for good art Becuase of how picky I am, and that’s something I would use
They have a really dark and mesgevious look
Really like the colour palette 🎨 and shading
I agree with fin <@!296572507241054209> , I think of the art o have seen by you this far it’s my fave, I love it
such a good game guys
Haha
and play age of empires 3
i used to come back from school in grade 9
good memories
since i played this
holy shit its been a long time
saying i have sold items on the market
i just got 38 emails from steam
https://youtu.be/ADtyN0G5G3c
Yess she's literally channelling calypso from Pirates of the Carribean
yeah! or looking down at a lantern in the spooky pirate night
Oh thank you, bottom lighting, like holding a flashlight under ur chin
just all around a good job
I really really like the shading, how she is lit from the front
Not meant as an underhanded insult!!! Not at all! But I wanted to say I think it is the best work youve done that I have seen, stylistically, perspective-wise, form, proportionally, I think its really good
I kind of hate it because I looked at it too long
Thank you!!!!
8O
I think its my favourite of yours yet

Too u tooooo

By being able to choose trump and know roughly what is in your deck
Since war by itself is entirely strategyless, this adds a tiny tiny bit of strategy
Card Game idea:
War but there are trump suits.
Leave jokers in deck.
Jokers: 
First joker played allows player to establishes a trump
Subsequent jokers allow player to change trump when played
Jokers always lose except to trump cards. Jokers beat all trump cards (the trump established before it switches on that turn)

That sucks 😦
incompatible version
too bad
:lenny_Shrug:
if youre playing with someone on a pc
also even if you bypass that
then it instantly crashes
then it works except for when you load a game up
just for it to tell me it couldnt load a single xml file that shows you the borders of your cities
i waited two hours to download civ 5
God damn magic
I’m happy when they work at all
Their fucking magic

What is the largest animal you have ever stunned with a taser before butchering?

A lot of people agree that it was a big bear with a rare disorder called too much electricity in the blood, but it was actually the biggest bird in the world, and now I am the most important part of our ecosystem.
whether its environmental, social, or economic
Sustainability just implies being able to carry out actions or developments in the long term that are beneficial now without creating a burden on future generations
I don't even know anything about that field
I don't have any suggestions unfortunately
Hahaha
idk how OS's are involved though
and lol i could probably try to figure out a way to employ a neural network somehow
anything in environmental sustainability, i just need to commit to something im passionate about and that will be groundbreaking and something that i will be good at, bc it would be how i spend an entire year of my life and would include a ~50 page microthesis
do some AI research and explain why windows 1.0 is by far the best OS to do it with
<@!331154975457673228> what subject do you have to research

Oh nice
I think I can apply to have a cheque sent whenever
When do you get it?
or id be screwed
thank god the shcool owes me money
I definitely love a nice industry night
Oh no doubt dude
we gotta do some industry nights
sweet!
and lunch money beers
yeah man i love your place too, you get a lot of the same stuff, gang beasts etc, but there something special about the loft, and their nachos

you guys aren't down to be pirates
I assume
And more spirits and mixes
Gunna buy a metal platter and some whiskey glasses

<:ScreenShot20191116at1:645148010812276737>

Is that.... Good?
It tasted like mulled wine
Was it yummy
Every drink is $15+
Felt bad man
Oooooh
On somerset
I got a $20 mix drink at wabbajockey
Nick once ordered a 22 dollar glass of bourbon
Haha if it’s not an entire pay check worth then you’re certifiably poor
Ew! 500? Nothing less than 1500!!
Now that’s prestigious
Get a $500 whiskey
Any hobo can buy that
Go big or go home, no one cares about a $100 whiskey
I told him we need to clean up a part of the counter for it
Let it age for 60 years
He's driving haha
It’s even more prestigious if you never open it
Also Jesus Christ Finn
Yeahhhhhhhhhh
Nick says that the whiskey is all about prestige
Who needs internet or a pc to game
Finished episode 2
Nick I just played life is strange for 3 hours streaming using my phone hotspot
Hahaha
Defy gravity choke on hairspray hair
It’s a vibe
She was at lcbo
Speak to the manager Karen hair
I just saw her hair
Was she shopping at Walmart
Did she have talons
Omg
I totally just saw Theresa Caputo the long Island medium
If you did a double blind taste test on me
I bet I couldn’t tell the difference between a $1000 whiskey and a $15 whiskey
🙂

I think it refreshess in like a day or two though
6GB
streaming will use it all lol
how much data do you have
oh no
ive been using my mobile hotspot lol
i'll play around witht hat next time I try it
ncie

lol

life is strange
but then again
ah, strange
if youre bandwidth is too high, itll increase latency
you can also play with bandwidth throttling which fixes latency issues
with 1gbps i bet you could get 720p though at a minimum working really well
yeah that wasn't happening
lmao
on satellite internet
so it was trying to stream in 2k for me
the default resolution is that of your screen
Hahaha yeah
maybe i'll set up a steam machine on my computer
limit resolution down from 4k
i'll do that
set it to fast
go into streaming settings next time you try it
they definitely made some improvements to it
quick time events are rare
I'm surprised it works so well
yeah
not bad for a game that doesnt have like combat or anything
only a slight delay
latency is very bareable though
Hahaha
overall its better than when i played LiS 1 on my mac mini at 11fps
audio stuttering
but it stutters a tiny bit
the latency isnt bad
medium low
How's the lag?
Oh hell yeah!
at 480p!
this is playable
fuck yes!
now its permanently running on my pc and i cant close it
fuck not this glitch again
lol
limited it to 480p
so i was streaming in 2K
boom
so that it never buffers lol
i wonder if theres a streaming option to stream it to me in 360p or something
Oh damn
and until boxing day atleast
i thinik they must have improved it though
how long are you down for
😦
which makes it impossible to play
which it is doing here
as long as the game doesnt keep pausing and buffering
honestly i dont even care if its 100ms
oh nice
tiny bit of ping (20ms) but it didnt bother me
Last time I tried it it was awful
oh neat
oh really?
never buffered or anything
it worked well for me at home with only like 100mbps
also its bullshit that all cell networks need to have throttles
streaming barely even works with 1Gbps internet tbh
😦
stupid satellite internet
fuck i wish the internet was good enough here to stream single player games
creating a market for things that have no value then taking little bits off of every transaction
its genius
Yeah it's greedy
Hahaha
oh okay
"here you guys give each other money for these digital things i can make endlessly, and ill take a lil cut!"
although i'm still heading back tonight
yes
So is everyone home now
they create money only to take away
damn
2 cents off of every trading card sold
steam makes like $500 per hour 24 hours per day just off of marketplace microtransaction fees
Not sure if it’s better or not. I can trim it more at parents, they have working scissors

I took out a good chunk but my scissors are really poor at cutting anything
Dnt ded
looks like i will have to READ BOOKS
well that was a failed experiment
😦
this is so fucking dumb
and i cant get it to stop running
its runnign on my pc now and not streaming
holy fuck
this is a technology dead zone
wow
assertion failed
I have no idea what went wrong
FUCK
trying to stream game
Lol better do that
i forgot my phone charger i need to buy a new one lol
And the tv
😦
Just my phone
I don’t have one either
so i cant play single player games
i didnt even bring my pc
fuccck
We are in this together fin
Same lol
That’s gunna be like me soon
rip me for the next two weeks
Hey
<@!136253782131474432>
FFS

thats what my barber does
True
you can also trim the stash just so it doesnt hang into your lip, like cut it just so it matches the line of your lip
If it’s bad I take it all off
Yes that is true
Once I finish showering. May be a bit
good
its good to practise to see what looks god
sounds good! Worst case you just get rid of it 🙂 nothing to lose
and a bit off the chin
Ok. I’ll do a trim and see from there
yeah just take 1/3 off on the sides
okay thats fine!
it can go down though
The chin is where it’s thinnest lol
like 90 degree angle
you just dont want it sticking outwards
yeah, but chin can be longer if you know what i mean
Ok, so try to make it the same length all the way across
as long as its even
maybe take 1/3 off
sides
you can have it longer on the chin than the side
Like just take scissors and eye-ball it
How would I go about trimming it. What length
Don't cut off that glorious thing
its in style right now
Do that
Hum
Yes
and youd look reaally nice and proper
give the beard a little trim just make it an even length
Better than mine :())
keep the stash, clean up the beard
My mustash feels like whale teeth
Maybe I won’t shave it just yet
its not even a dirt stash its better than mine 😭
I agree
Hum
you look great with it
i love your beard
Grow something like this

Reminds me of the electronic artist Savant
Goatee
The goatss
I always thought it looked nasty
Yes
The dirt stash looks good?
At least the moustache
That honestly looks awesome
Shon no keep that

About to shower then trim the beard away. This will be the final record of its existence

sleep well
thank you nickobelic
have a nice night shonothan
gotta work tomrorow
also ima pass out now
yes
just so far in left field you dont even see it coming
no one expects full retard
its so stupid it might just work
that's why it might just work
it's too ridiculous to work
yes
a front
no one would ever even THINK it was a cover up
groomed them into perfect drug lords
they planned it from the start
People would never believe miley cirus is actually a massive meth traficker
its just a HUGE cover up
They make people famous
lol
distributor
imagine nicholodian is actually a front for a meth distrubtor
I thought that'd be hilarious
I was thinking that nicolodian star turn drug lord was not impossible
lmao
ah
Turns out all she is is bipolar and drove under the influence once
that part had me like "wait a minute"
Thinking the meth part had to be real
I actually googled her after watching that
me too lmao
I know when I saw it, I was thinking it might be real up till the al-Qaeda
legit the devil
source of all human suffering
But i'm scared
I don't know hwo amanda is
I
I
I think you will enjoy that video nick
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORB_7ady8aM
my computer physicly pains you
😦
: ^ )
)
^
:
please
shon
so yea. that be me pc
cant think of anything else off the top of my head
hum
my headset setup is nasty, two different headphones (one with a mic, one without) then I have plugged in at the same time
I once found system32 in the recycling bin
Lets see... what else is wrong with my pc...
but then it will fix itself
Sometimes my PC audio will glitch, and every 10 seconds my audio will stutters. I timed it, its litteraly EVERY 10 seconds
whenever I open a file and search for something, it takes 3 mins of the file frozen before it will begin searching (or letting me type for that matter) even if the file is small. Once I do this once a day, however, its fine for all files
so I just keep it on all the time to avoid that problem : ^ )
sometiems my PC does not power back up when it turns off
but also
(I notice when it flickers the top left is very dark, and its like a gradiant, getting brighter as it goes to the bottom right)
just missing every second fram
is not only because my screen flickers bady
the reason I dont turn off my pc
Also
oh boy
my pc is a little nasty
***dust***
just
well, I cant see inside
is
for the fan to blow air out of
the port on the side of my computer
yes
you know how the fan is always on?
Also
you can get one for $25
man just an SSD would solve that
they have gotten bad over the years
is loading times
The only thing I have -really- felt the pain of
your comptur is nasty
I just
I should only really need a $100 graphics card and i'll have the parts to build you something better
yes
its probobly dirt cheap to get anything better
I have parts laying around
lol
ill run it into the ground first
i'm going to get you a better computer
but I wont put it out of its missery
shon
its begging to die
its wheezing
mines still kicking
It was $500 in 2011 and yours was better than it
I used to have a mac mini that couldn't run mcuh
Hahaha
didint you use to say your computer couldnt run minesweeper
if I did not run that game I could litteraly say I have a 100% sucsess rate with every single game it has run
but that one game did not run
it has sucseded in running litteraly every other game I have put on it
thats the only game my PC cant run
Just Cause 3
only 1
I have actualy found a single game it CANT run
NO upgrades
it still runs modren games
and
im just looking at how old it is
My computer came out 5 years after wow
how the hell can you run so many things
it IS older then dota 2
This computer is almost older then TF2
: ^ )
:^)
60% of the time it works every time
all skill
I don't know how your computer is alive
tbh
I think it's just pure luck
... yes
for making this one last so long
i am increadible with computers
or
Haha
but i am not good with compooters
it might be possible
it
lol
I think you could get a better PC for $30 from value village
shon
glad you got it : ^ )
ah ok
that's not good
oh nooo
rip nik
But yea
if my monitor turns off
it shuts off my pc
including if it enters sleep mode
so instead I just have to go to a black screen saver when not in use
dead?
am i
can you hear me now?
*gone*
or is just
did you see my stuff
did
I think i'm back
I think
hello
😢
can you hear me nick?
from the looks of it
oh man none of my messages have gone through

I know that feeling nik
I CAN'T SEND ANY MESSAGES
My internet is barely usable
i'm in renfrew too
so instead I just have to go to a black screen saver when not in use
including if it enters sleep mode
it shuts off my pc
if my monitor turns off
But yea
rip nik
Dear god it's bad
My internet is not working in Renfrew
instead of sleeping, it has a black screen saver
Also lmao
my monitor does not go to sleep
also
non stop
its been on for 3-4 years now
efficeny
shon's is probably getting wrecked
I use the heat from the fan to heat up my beans
I mean it may wear it out a tiny bit faster
I’m going to stream single player games into my MacBook
It’s gunna be a gaming server
full speed
the fan is also on 247
lmao
Okay nice
on 247
computers are fine to be on all the time
mine never turns off
It’s gunna be on the whole break

There is not many places to hide stuff in our apartment, other then an unused cubort
And when I find it I’m so happy
I forget where I put it
Works for me
Hide it good
but its a good tip
it wont last too long : ^ )
haha
And then it becomes a nice surprise when you’re in dire straights
Advice: hide a bag out of sight
Yes
And yeah you’ll have enough before you go home so you don’t need to go for noodles until the new year
so thank yee
Nood,les would last longer, but... I have not had chips in a while, I could not resist
Noice

It’s wild that it takes 3 hours and 4 busses to get to kanata with a stop in Nepean
and thank ye for thee ree suply
safe travles fin
Yeah that's ridiculous
Still I left home at 3
Haha
I see that's less wild
On the 61
I’m 20 mins from kanata now
Ah
Took the 61 > 84
Nah I left Nepean 20 mins ago
I left at 5 or so
Are you only just getting to Nepean?
When did you leave work
I was in a meeting like two hours ago when you were heading out
I'm just about home
I’m on the last bus now
How the fuck
Wtf
Still 20 mins away lol
;( Jesus Christ
To get to kanata with a stop in Nepean
4 busses and 3 hours
Seeya
Alright see ya soon finre
so maybe
His doppleganger
unless he can teleport
I was just speaking to him
There’s someone that looks like him
No
Is there a chance that Tyler is on my bus rn
ill be at the lobylaw entrence closest to the road
Okay just wait in lobbylaw if you beat me there
im gunna leave now
alright
just awful
I started this ordeal at 2:30pm
It’s literally a day long journey to get from downtown to kanata with a stopover in Nepean
its because all you need is the 88 : ^ )
Idk why but Nepean is a dead zone for busses
Might have to just cab or something from lobbylaw to kanata
Yeah
hope you are too m8
i will try to be
Hope you are warm
its a bit of a walk to get to lobbylaw
Ok, ill be leaving soon
27 mins
Ok. Transport sucks m8
just the bus driver going in reverse
Yeah I’m still 35 mins away min
I imagin it is
lol
Just reversing
Wrong side of the road
Just the 88 going straight backward
5 minutes until arrival
4 minutes until arrival
3 minutes until arrival
Love when the estimated time ticks upwards
So, I imagin you're gunna be at lobbylaw at a later time. Still update me ~20 mins in advance?
I feel you
If I can’t walk then I’m too far
I will never live away from downtown
I hate Nepean and kanata
good luck fin
I hate oc transport
I’m heading to billing’s
It's legit dangerous
I have ducking frostbite
Jesus
Thanks oc transport
Then 88
Yeah take the six
I left home at 3 and here I am!!!
Oh ducking hell
I’m at home!!!!!!
Oh my fuck 88 it is
Where are you right now
Fuck that
And the 55 only comes every half an hour
I've had a bus stop cancle on me once, but thankfuly there was another stop near by. Its still BS that there is no way to know that *nothing* is comming unless you look online
I’m not taking the 88
This is why I want to move out of that black hole
What the actual fuck
How the fuck is it impossible for me to get to baseline
Then tunneys to baseline
Ahhh
I wanted to take the 14 to tunneys
What bus stop
That’s a fucking pass!
Are you fucking kidding me!
Now it’s saying I have to go to ducking billing’s bridge and take the 88!
thats bs
Half an hour freezing my ass off and I haven’t even started journey
oh man
Holy fuck I’m mad
You’d think they’d put a ucking sign
I just waited half a ducking hour at a stop that isn’t even fucking running
I’m so fucking mad
Fuck oc transport
Holy fuck
probobly inside the entrance area to not freeze to death
I know ill be near the entrance to the lobylaw near the road
its obtuse
Ottawa is stupidly big
This is a 2 hour journey to get to kanata
Yea bus sucks
I hate bussing
Thats fine!
Probably 4:15
Ill be a bit late
Oh nice
Half way point between where fin will be and where I am
And I’m going to frew tomorrow but fin and I are meeting up quickly at lovbylaw
I’m a slow walker
Maybe text when your 20 mins away
Sure!
You guys heading to the frew?
Ill text you when im 15 mins away?
Leaving now
Btw what time do you think you’ll be near the lobbylaw <@!331154975457673228>
Yea it’s chilly.
this is going to be an awful bus ride
just spooked about having it in -20
okay nice
Yeah it'd be fine
bc i need to bus to kanata

very much
i love classical art
but uh finn how much would a roman-esque art from your dad be
for the next session when I come back
this other thing I have to do within 2 weeks

oh no*
gi bi
my players, last session, found a lot of magical items.
like a lot.
and I have to make descriptions for every single one.
Each item is usualy around 2-4 paragraphs
and oh you wanna write a story for ur mome
i would love to do stuff like thta
how come shon?
but he lost to some dumb proposal of two guys on stilts
he was summoned to like do a competition for a commission for the museum
i didnt know that was something that would happen
I have to do a lot of writing over chrismas break
ooh so they wanted to use it for like examples?
In unrelated news
Oh also
the museum of history i think took an interest in his stuff bc its very true to the roman style
im a whore for classical greek/roman art
Hahah from broke artist to broke artist
i have.... 70 dollars roughly
i can give him everything in my wallet
we may have some roman style coasters left over
can i pay him to make it again for me
ike 10 years ago
https://i.imgur.com/rDFsD6D.jpg

i love it
thats a classic roman style
can i buy this
and yeah
its very old though
https://www.freewebs.com/torontogonemosaic/artists/aquilo_mosaics/images/fisher_dark.jpg
oh wait is this his stuff?
its not his
No idea who made this website about him\
like they look specifically for layout artists
https://www.freewebs.com/torontogonemosaic/artists/aquilo_mosaics/aquilo_mosaics.html
he could make so much money in the animation business
so thats good
layout type stuff right???
but she loves it
idk if my mum made much of any money from being an artist
your dad does like
that it still came out to $1 per hour
thatssss rough
it took so many hours to make

they are not rigidly defined for our whole lives
but personalities are also fluid
it only tells you a bit about your GENERAL personality based around the questions you were asked
theres basically no trend from the boxes that myers briggs puts you in and like your abilities or health or stuff
INTJ's
what did it say about
or "INFPs are more likely to be able to learn a language latter in life"
like the ability to say: "INFPs are more likely to be good painters"
i see
its just the extrapolations that have limited scientific support
fix any problem
flex seal
just slap them on like
so it will fit you well
all better
Yeah myers briggs is based on real data (your survey)
thats good to hear
ah ok
he'll be fine
ill use my crystals and sage him
dont worry
rip nick
nick has cancer?
bc girl you got good dice rools
I know the myers brig thing fits me well. I am very logic driven, very rules adbiding, and like to be by meself

some people are very accurate to their signs some arent
that is much much much worse than 50-50 chance lmao
it took her 8 guessses
I made a hardcore astrologist predict my sign based on my personality
WHAT ARE YALLS ZODIAC SIGNS
the day you are born on dictating your future
im so aquarius
Astrology is just another form of numerology lol
fight me
Pseudoscience exists on a spectrum
real af
also ummmmmm zodiac?????
I love it, but its only slightly more supported than astrology
hahahahaha ok no thats not me
ENFP is protagonist
yeah!
INFP is mediator
the mediator ?
but it unfortuantely has no scientific support lmoa
im pretty sure im actually like
So is Annie
I am INFP
Yeah I love myers briggs
your wrong
im enfp whatever
hey
Pervasive pseudoscience that sucks though for example: Chiropractor for example: FAKE as fuck. Non MSI accupunture: FAKE as fuck, reflexology: FAKE, Myers Briggs tests: FAKE
and its left a really nasty taste in my mouth
its just there are groups taking too much advantage on pusodo
feel better
burn some sage
If you know its pusudo, could you make... a water bottle your holy symbol. Like if you like your crystals, all the power too you
like i am genuinely very superstitious and sometimes i get genuinely afraid of bad energy and ghosts and shit
you arent perpetuating it, and you are a concious user
i love it
its nice
and I even use sage
but yeah i love that you can do that ! and my mom can
Its much more pervasive than some people think
FOR FUN
USING CRYSTALS
im just
like im not trying to perpetuate it!!!!!
Thats what I was trying to say fin
Pseudoscience is a scurge on humanity
but you can do placebo at home! if you convince yourself that daily vitamins will help you just as much
what i dont like that is generally my issue, is that any time i admit to using these things it ALWAYS gets brought up how awful psuedoscience is
Placebo is proven to help mental health yes
ive been in and out of ALOT of counselling things and ive learned things that have been scientifically proven to help with mental stability and i combine it with stuff that i can then use to kind of give me a way to utilize it in my real life
Its much more pervasive than most people think
I just think the industry should be regulated a bit more to prevent the worst case scenarios
but that shouldnt stop people like my mum from burning sage to feel nice
Shon is right in one thing though: Is that when health care is monetized, or pseudoscience therapy is managed by corporations who seek only profit, there is always the chance that some poor people who dont know any better will be convinced that these things are the answer TO EVERYTHING (often more than real medicine) and it can bankrupt, and even kill people.
like its comforting and calming which allows to to be able to like handle more insensive stressors
for mental fortitude
like i said this stuff is like
like a smudge stick
hahahaha i love sage i have sage with me all the time
its sorta like sage burning, i know it does nothing, my mum knows it does nothing, but she did it anyways during her chemo treatments because it made her feel good, and that made me feel good. However it definitely did not stop her from doing chemo lmao
the issue is i think largely no.1 america's health care makes it so people get desperate and no.2 is dumbass people trying to be organic and chemicals are bad mannnnn
of course! like i think what we need to do is educate what these can ACTUALLY do for you and not lie to people
Its like religion, I dont want to do it, and I get nothign from it, but some people really do and that is their right, and i dont want to take that away from them, its nice really. Especially when it gives peace of mind it can have very real effects on mental health, which actually lead to improved effects on physical health! But when religion / spirituality/ pseudoscience / crystals start getting in the way of traditional medicine (e.g. jehovas witness not being able to have blood transfusions) it can become a really big risk to them, so as long as it stays relatively seperate from normal medicine and science, it can have great positive effects!
they are fun and spirituality is good for the SOUL
it
like
i just
and im not saying that theres nothing negative about it before we go that route
but im gonna have my pretty crystals and nice smells and take my perscription medications on top of it and be hAPPY
honestly if you wanna see something wholly negatively just because you dont like it go for it
i just thought it was funny that they said you could clean it by blowing on it and pretending it was clean
rip fins braincells
honestly i didnt bring this up to argue about my beliefs in it haha
i like how ive been educated in this topics and am not contributing at all to the discussion bc i only have 1 not dead braincell rn lmao
i mean we have shit that says that works but if you use crystals to make you feel better and it does..
and it terms of emotionally manipulating people you could say therapy and counselling does that through the things they teach you. thought therapy is basically trying to MANIPULATE YOURSELF to have more positive thoughts
i mean if you dont want to take medication and you want to feel better this is something you can use as a crutch
medication? pharmacy companies
And, if you are NOT aware its a placebo, is the group misguiding those people? manipulating them?
i mean your money goes somewhere no matter what
One thing I think though is that, if you are aware that they are more-or-less placebo, they dont do anything other then make you feel better because you have associated them with making you feel better, could you have done that with *something else* rather then paying a group to give you said crystal/herb?
*im fucking spiritual and full of good fucking vibes*
and dont talk shit ,, about my herbal medicine and crystals
i am passionate about these things
the crystals kind of become your thing that you think about to say i dont need to feel this way because of this rather than i dont need to feel this way because if i feel this way then it affects this blah blah blah
i think its super good for people who dont respond to that thought therapy thing that they try to teach you in counselling
stuff like that is definately good for mental fortitude , like if you have something bad happen to you that day and maybe you did a fuckin crystal thing to make you have positive vibes or something you'll say that doesnt bother me ,, my CRYSTALS are giving me positive vibes
and if you feel like doing a thing with crystals every morning energizes you and makes you happy for the day and it DOES because you believe it does then you know
thats definately a thing and if you start to associate a certain smell to being relaxed you become relaxed
like how smelling something can induce feelings
mostly to emotional and mental things
because i genuinly believe that they and essential oils and all that stuff does have benifits
well i mean yeah
the thing is CRYSTALS are not the problem its people
Yeah we learned about all the pseudoscience stuff in science communciation class
its literally because in america people who cant afford medical care become desperate and turn to anything
fucking gilly juice
Some groups are trying to sell it as a way to use instead of trusting 'big pharma', and they misinform people and cuase harm to everyone
haha gilly juice
but you can find shit like that super easily what im saying is that crystals arent wide spread enough to cause REAL harm
look it up THATS fucked
and it only takes 1 to missinform somone to lead to them getitng hurt
like gilly juice is a thing like that that got commercial and huge
there is A LOT of groups that are trying to take advantage
i mean like largely commerically
Thats the thing though
ok but you look anything uup llike that on google you get SOMETHING like that
Fin comming down hard
lol
Some will say "Dont use in place of medice!" but there are a lot of groups that will take advantage.
https://reioflightjewelry.com/blogs/crystal-corner/which-crystals-aid-in-cancer-healing
crystals would be like MUCH harder to convince than herbal medicine
that ends up actually helping
Most of the time its just a nice lil placebo
not crystals
herbal medicine yes
Most of the time its great
ive never seen crystals
not always
BUT
very toxic
its
brianna
have
yeah they ahve
cure cancer
the moment its predatory, it sucks
yeah but crystals have NEVER been sold to be able to like
as long as you dont use it in place of modern medicine it doesnt hurt anyone
that are willing to take advantage of others
I like placebo
herbal medicine
there is a lot of people out there selling crystal/herbal stuff, etc
thats more like
its more like, cleanse negative energy from your body
The average person speaks at somewhere between 125 and 150 words per minute.
well crystals have never been suggested to be able to do that
holy fuckk
the problem starts when people say it will help you with a curable desise, so people use it instead of getting the cure, then get fucked up because they did not get the legit cure
134
how many words is that per minute
in 10 hours
4026 words
holy fuck
like if it improves your mental state go for it
if you believe it works it will and thats good enough
its like
nahh i do believe a little
modren day snake oil
are just
all of those things
blowing on the stone and IMAGINING im cleaning it
im just
imagine you are removing the negativities
blow on the stone
HHHH
and the way it suggests cleaning the stones has me like
oh no
im reading a book on how to cleanse myself with crystals
you can bask in having finished your work

That's hilarious
Its literally sterile due to behavior
or like its so bad at sex that the partner gives up
exactly
physicly able, but nothing can wants to
not actually autistic, but its behaviour is so bad that nothing wants to mate with it
oh lol
basically a hybrid of two species is autistic and cant find a mate

what is that
the idea of behavioural sterility is hilarious
guys

Lmao wtf is that
lmao promiscuous protein
You got this Finn don't worry
Oh baby that's my life
actually shaking with anxiety i feel like i need to shit myself lmao
you'll get through it dude
I know that feeling
😦
Exam is in 12 hours so I guess I could do it all in 10
I’m currently getting through like 1 every half hour
Like 20 more lectures to go through
Really shoulda gone to more classes or studied earlier
Ducking hell in so underprepared for this exam
It's gross and I hate it
I kinda like it
lmao
i drew this at work  in front of everyone
lol oh yeah
I got it from a friend but hated how big it was
the one plus 3
my brother has my phone that I had for all of two weeks now
I know*
I lmao
when your gma has a better phone than your brother
thats terrible
then my mum got my grandmas old iphone 6
the SE is good
lmao my mum and brother used a 5c all the way up until a few months ago
5c was ass though
The X and up seem nice again too
the iphone 5s was nice
man that phone sucked
oh god yeah
but still its horrible
was probably faster on whatever old ios it had i guess
even for 2014
can you imagine
like its such trash
i feel so bad for the people that spent $1000 on the iphone 6 when it came out
lol
thinking about the cost of things is for plebs
so youd start saving after only 3 months
I'm a rich boi now
so if you extract it from bill 65-27, then you save 30 a month (if you see the contract to the end)
oh well
Yeah
thats true i guess its just inside your bill
As I was paying more monthly before I got this
Well, if I go through the whole contract I won't have paid a single dollar for it
so you start saving after 10 months
you paid 100 extra
but you paid 650 - 550
you save 10 per month
75-65 = 10
idc honestly
math
if you do that mat
that kinda cancels out your savings tbh
I'm paying less than before monthly
oh well
huh
CAD
canadian
https://store.google.com/ca/config/pixel_3a
Is that american?
fido over sells it
unless you got XL
ah

$549 from joogle
lemme check
i thought it was only like $540
It's so nice
and it was voted top phone of the year
also lol I don't know if this is right
oh hey thats what annie is getting


google pixel 3A
so what phone is it
I hate being trapped
I wasn't going to get it if I couldn't do that
most dont have that clause
yeah i like that you can opt out
I'll definitely buy it out long before 2 years are over
also the law could change requiring better plans and stuff too
But this lets me stretch it a bit
Haha yeah I was going to buy a phone outright
the new unlimited plan could come out any day
also plans change
i break stuff
i still wouldnt ever get a contract longer than a year
not terrible
gotcha
So like after 10 months it'll be $650-(10*$27)
no, I pay $65 a month but the total bill goes down $27 a month
yeah i never use the full 6Gb
oh nice
do you have to pay full price of phone in order to drop cvontract
But I was paying $75/month for 10Gb before
Gunna drop a couple hundred on it here and there
I will most likely pay off the phone before then once I start getting my money
ah nice i have the same plan
$65/month for 6GB of data
and are you stuck on a contract with someone now for two years
2 years but at any time I can just pay for it and get out
how long do you have to pay it off for
also fin I got a new phone for free and my monthly payment actually went down
thats definitely a thing
maybe like professional bomb defusers
lmao

Burst generator by the chemical brothers is good
And oh no what was it
Oh damn ima save this playlist
i googled similar songs to flute songs and it gave me a really gross song
<@!136253782131474432>  oh no
but its a fine line that when you cross you become EDM
I wish there was more happy house/ drum n bass like the flute song lmao
For a gnarly catchy one I recommend: https://open.spotify.com/track/6kgZxL7xye0tvIP0j38xUc?si=sABpyWKlQ9ucYhn_j8Ohlg

I left work early today to study
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/654153642357686303/654186047810306048/unknown.png this one is honestly even funnier for some reason
*Jesus*
Just
I love the comment
if you want to upvote
Posted it

Why


ok
to see if the parts are still there
ill try
no i can recreate it though
thats how much mine is worth today?
$239
just over 200
there
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/H7MRK4
AMD Radeon HD 6800 series
from device manager
oh and what's the video card again
here is my spec

you beat me on price though
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/9bRQPn
truee
I decided putting all the money into a new CPU with a decent integrated gpu would be a better use of money
yeah I decided to skip even adding a gpu
lmao
look at the GPU though lmfao
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/f4Zt7T
so you can see how much it would cost
how do I get specs in windows 10
and
I do have a fan
factor in the cost of a small table fan
hm that might not work well with the computer
from the freezer
oh
he uses ice
doesnt he not
lol
shon has a table fan i'm sure
fans
but fabn
We'll build it in a cardboard box
fuck the case
cheapest case is $24
yeah im having trouble
But still cheap as hell
So it's going to be over $100 for brand new
OK the $100 mark was factoring in salvaging an old computer from ebay or something
Oh yes
i need shons specs though so we can compare
nice
pcpartpicker.com
on newegg?
ok one second ima do it
i need specs
I could build you a better computer for $100
i'm pretty sure
i'm uh
I wonder how much it would cost to get my pc today
it is
(jk)
other than Shon's computer, which is from 2009
weird to think that if we had our current set-up in 2009, it would have costed >$10k probably
so this is proof that in 10 years everyone will have those specs
That sounds rivht
or something
in different places
Yes
it can be very bright and very dim at the same time
Extreme high dynamic range
Whatever that is
Also, it has extreme HDR
Imagine like 6 1080p monitors put together
At that point you just have an insane amount of space for Windows
it congeals anything thats put inside ofi t
can your eye even see more than 4k
isnt a 6k monitor like dimishing returns
maple surup flavoured milk
Yeah...
did you see the image of the milk tyler got today
oh nick
Yes
Oooh
It's the sexiest cheese grater
with hackintosh
and just put my current set up in it
i want the case
is the screen even 8k
That'd be fucking ridiculous
imagine having three raw 8K movies playing at once
That's pretty insane though
Haha Jesus
Adding Apple's Afterburner card, an accelerator card that enables playback of three streams of RAW 8K video at once, will cost an extra $2,000.
Then the screen is $5000 and another $1000 for the monitor stand
theres a $50k model
But it is insane
Haha it is ridiculously powerful
you could get a brand new car
do you think that is worth it
jesus christ
Not close*
oh man
$28k for the one he has
Close
also this is the most clueless ive ever been for a paper
*
$5000
probably like $500
I know! I want one
and easily accessible
it actually looks nice inside
wow
<@!136253782131474432>
this is real???
wtf
is this the guy who really sucks at computers
it must be
thought it was typo
also wtf lol
no
*28 Core Intel Xeon CPU*
*384GB DDR4 ram*
should I buy the new mac pro
<@!331154975457673228>
ehhh hehahheha hhhhhhhahhhaa
that sounds so creepy
Heeeeehhhhhhhhhh heeeeehhhhhh heeeeeeehhhhh

its bad
its
"shake well"
nooo
not falling
he turned his whole bowl upside down, it there is like an inch of it just sitting there
it congealed
the bottom of his bowl
and
with that maple surap milk
Tyler made some oatmeal
yeah im happy
94% is gud
nice
that i did entirely in the 2 days of extension
got 94 on the essay i stayed up until 4am doing
Maybe there are no peas
Maybe the peas are a lie
maybe it was photoshoped to look better
youd think if they were photoshoppin gthe food theyd make it look more appetising
im scared
oh god wjhat

So yea, after christmas I'll have to go
oh man
Mine not only ripped there, but they also ripped down the front. idk how it even happend. Just right down one leg, from like the belt to half way to the knee
all of the buttons fell off within two weeks
i guess i bought three pair of identical pants for $10 each lol
they are built to fall apart 😦
Same
i feel like they should last longer
yeah true
Guess cause legs rubbing together
the ones I am wearing right now are developing a new rip in teh same spot
I know, its awful when that happens. Its always there they rip too it seams
had to be cross-legged the rest of the day
awful experience
thank god noone saw
and my balls were just hanging out in public once
I have like 4 pairs and 2 of them have groin rips
They had a tear in them beofre, but it got to the point where its like im not even wearing pants anymore. So yea.
That sucks!
oh dang!
Not yet because... Well...
I uh...
My pants are ripped. Like. I cant be seen in public ripped. Im getting some new ones when I go home for christmas.
you have a chance to go to clinic shon?
yeah same, wish i had a job lined up for january
hum yea. Hope she finds whats right for her
the local one is a very very steep learning curve
she is passionate about indigenous one but it is high risk, with isolation and social issues up north
yeah, tough cross roads though
Lucky for her
Second is about $25 / hour for 6 months in Northern indigenous community in Quebec
One is a $27.50 / hour 1 year contract in Ottawa
oh wow
Annie just got two job offers within 9 minutes
Hahahaha

love it
Great one
:[
This meme sounds like something Shon would say
I think he blocked me
thats really funny
lol
Don't text me , this is a lesson
Sent the bee movie script

oh boy

The economy is not well
*a single hat*
you can buy a hat with that
nice
oh wow
We just made around $12,000 from skulls
You can play without me, but thats when we can all play as a group
lol
and dont currently have a job lined up yet
i wont be in school anymore
i guess we shall play on the 1st and beyond
so when fin is done I wont be able to play 😦
until the 1st
for like
no computer and real shity internet
I know on the 20th im going back home to my parents
poor ifn
Probably a good idea
:(
half
i think i need to call it for the next week and a hal
yeah i couldnt play anyways
nice
Just putting in a half hour or so
Brianna has to go to work real soon so we can't really set sail eight now
doing roll20 work
Lmao
I cant play rn either
with devil poison
are tempting me
you gutys
:/
it jsut sucks because i dont even agree with a lot of the policy isntruments in the first place
its more like you have to use this topic as a means to describe how policy instruments work and stuff
nah its really not about arguing
exercise
if you need to support it, see it as a debate excersise
Or do you *need* to support it
are you allowed to argue it
lol nice
I got most of the marks still
The textbook said that GMOs were bad and a "forced trial on unwilling people"
I got angry in one of my living green assignments
ah, argue it well and your prof will probably give you a decent grade
I just know im going to get a terrible mark on this alredy
but i mean regulating the issue? forcing people to not be assholes with law?
media
people are just assholes, and if gender representation is unequal in the media or TV, it can and should simply be solved by not endorsing media that is clearly inequal in an asshole way. Then assholes dont make money, and people treat women and men equally in th emedia
yeah, that's definitely a stretch
just saying that it would somehow fix climate change, war, and world hunger is a stretch
totally behind that cause
dont get me wrong
I whole heartedly think we need full on gender equality though
And yes i need to write 2500 words on policy issues around gender diversity for my terrible policy class
Since women are equal and possess the same talents and skills as men, why would helping equality bring any form of change to those issues?
is this something you have to read for an assignment?
what is this?
but saying it is the most pressing issue of the world? and that solving it will feed the hungry and stop war and climate change?
and that it is infact an issue
I beleive whole heartedly in gender equality
I straight up dont agree with this
Geena DAVIS: In my opinion, the biggest problem we have in the world — of all the problems that we have — is gender inequality. If we were able to fix that, so that women were no longer second-class citizens, I think it would impact every other problem that we have — hunger and the environment and war. I don’t mean to say that it will cure the other problems, but it would go a long way toward improving these other stubborn problems.

I mean, women in most sectors of society — well, in every single sector — there’s big gender inequality. But as far as the leadership positions go, a lot of times, progress seems to stall out at about 20 percent. Congress is 20 percent women, and so many other areas of society are similar. So we’re not using, by any means, all of the talent of women. And the evidence has shown that if you correct that, and get all of the best minds working, things will improve. And women and men just have a different view of the world. There’s all these studies that show that when a body is more blended, where it’s not homogenous, it makes smarter and better decisions.
this assignment is stupid
I'd have slept through whatever I needed to do lol
i was up at 8
lmao
I slept until 12:30
it was and i'd imagine haha
im tired as fuck today though
that was fun last night
Hahaha
Ocean Man - Ween is my sea of thieves theme song


shon
whats up sho
I leave for two fucking seconds

hi bot
ah yea
actually that might not be the best cus then Brianna can't talk
I guess so
oh boy
want to play through in game voice
join us up
avast matey
We're just setting sale
Hell yeah
pirate it up
I can
any of you lads available for being a pirate
damn it
```:(```
🙂
🙂
you're a cool bot bot
sup bitches!
hi bot
bot
hi bot
hi bot

i'm sure nobody really cares
Still
:/
and i was like "I didnt have any problems with you until just now"
he genuinely thought we were being mean to him for some reason
nah noone saw him as an asshole
well, now there's a reason for him to not get invited to things
while he just stood there with a shit faced smile
Haha, man I don't think anyone really carews
i was full on yelling at him lol
im just a guy who yells at people at parties now though
he was being an ass
But I don't think it's really that bad of a look
yep
emotions were high because of alcohol
Haha
then i calmed down and talked it down
we didnt fight though lmao
and asked him if he wanted to fight lol
so i yelled at him and called him a self absorbed asshole who thinks the world revolves around him
anyways i got mad that i put myself out there and he was mean back, and had this stupid shit faced smile
it sounds like he was being the cunt
oh
its because his ex was our subletter over the summer
and he was mean and called us assholes and stuff
and was super nice about it
so i walked up to him to tell him thats not true
just a guy thought we didnt like him for some reason and were being weird to him fo rthe past month or so
<@!331154975457673228> what did you get in a fight about
it's definitely different
yeah
yea being in dedt sucks. I dont have a credit card so I cant go negitive, so when I have 0 I have 0. But I guess that looks better then -600.
Instead rn I'm just -$600 in credit card debt
If I had my pay that I'm going to be getting soon I'd prefer you pizza
:(
or chips
I just want junk food to eat away my sorrows
or chips
yea. I wish I had a pizza rn :/
and time in general
But yeah that's all around a really shitty night man
that's a good idea
I can wait for when they contact me, but its added up to the list of things frustrating me. And I think tyler and I are taking a trip to the food bank this month, but thanks for the offer.
I have unlimited calling on my phone
if you ever need food man or need to call someone you can come over here
ah 😦
I dont have a phone to call people, I have to wait for my mum to be on facebook on her labtop.
why can't you get a hold of your parents?
☹️
it is awful 😦
how was he being an asshole?
that's awful shon
shit guys 😦
uhg im just so frustrated right now
And not transferable. Its map making for a new area.
Its at least 5 hours of work. More like 8
is any of the work you did last time transferable?
😦
If I dont do it then I have to cancle the session for my players tomorrow.
yay
now im going to be forever known as the guy who yells at people at parties
I got into an argument with an asshole at a party last night
I know how you feel

just a bad day. I also have to do a lot of work for a session tomorrow and im really not feeling like doing it.
i just got access back now

and then I saw a megeladon after I sunk the ghost pirates as the kraken was destroying me
then I got pelted by cannonballed from a ghost ship as I was fending off the kraken
the water turned dark as a kraken attacked me
i was in sea of theives and the world just hated me

second one is creating a 30 slide powerpoint and 4000 words of notes (needs to be equivalent to 30 mins of speakign time) on comparing the future of the Arctic vs the Antarctic
😦
my first one is writing 2000 words on policy issues, framed through the issue of gender diversity in the media
I got both my takehomes released
Hahaha

I think I bugged it out by literally only playing mac demarco in 2016

My top song of the decade is big titty trippin

ohok
You can’t otherwise
It’s for talking to people outside your party
Also the megaphone thingy
ok
Hold g
how do you use pirate chap?
And they took sympathy and fixed my ship and invited me to join alliance lol
They all tried to completely obliterate me, but I used pirate chat to say “I need help”
oh thats nifty
It’s cross platform too, they were all on Xbox
huh thats cool
Turns out you can raise an alliance flag with a ship in proximity and you join their squad and both ships appear on your maps
noice
Ended up meeting a group of 4 on the 3 mast biggest ship and joined into an alliance with them and we took down ghost pirate ships and the megalodon
Hahahaha
Now im just outside the black water looking at the kraken
and i saw it being pulled under, on fire
then the much larger ship had its full attention
I somehow escaped its range
I hit it a ton with my cannons
we were fighting each other while the kraken destroyed our ships
lmao
then a kraken came out of nowhere and attacked both of our ships
it followed me
went horribly so I ran
uh oh
yes
I just tried to fight another ship
Guys
Glad youre done at least
done that
And haha
NIce!
I literally work further away from home than that lmao
I hate this class
```You are going to develop an environmentally friendly personal transportation plan.

Your dream home is located 12.5 km from your workplace, so you need to determine how you are going to get to work and back from your new home.

Given our weather extremes in the Ottawa area, you will need to have both a warm weather plan “S” summer and a cold weather plan “W” winter.

Please ensure that you keep this assignment as "real" as possible. If you plan on riding your bike in the middle of February when it is -35 C outside you will need special gear etc. You must note all of the associated cost and considerations related to your various modes of transportation...insurance, license fees, maintenance, parking etc.```

do you have a health card
yea thats kinda my situation right now. Food has to be cheap to get it
now he even buys some games every once and a while
She helped my uncle too who lives in Nepean in a simialr situation, he can't really work but used to not be able to afford food
As a social worker in renfrew
talking to my aunt about your situation this break, she helps get people ODSP all the time
Gotta take the rollplaying to the next level
Arr
but yea only pasta basicly. We did have butter but that ran out
just dont want you to get scurvy like our sea of thieves boys
yes
so I guess that kinda counts
I get a sauce that has bits of sosig in it
Well
no
uh
have you had any vitamin C or protein in the last few months?
so you only eat rice and pasta and pasta sauce?
so I cant afford it 😦
my budget is like $1.30 a day
but
that means you can spend $4 per day on food
3 bags is 2.1 days worth of food shon
2.83
i could use a dorrito
shon this may solve the pasta problem
I wish I could afford that deal 😦
so if I eat 4 large bags of doritoes in a single sitting i wont need to eat for the next  2.83 days
https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/doritos-nacho-cheese-tortilla-chips/6000196027727
Shon dorritos are 3 bags for $8 at walmart
then 1020/360 = 2.83 days worth of calories
so if 360 grams of dorritos is all you need for food for the day
and a large bag is 255 grams
well a small bag is 90 grams so
what about 4 large bags
did you know that eating 4 small bags of dorritos gets you your entire calorie intake for the day
Lol
My coworker keeps giving me weird pens

oh no

a couple
Send any emails?
thats a secret
Why is secret Santa low key complicated
Everybody is both giving and receiving a gift? Lol
It worked?
Haha nice
Excluding the ones you wanted to be not random
I wrote two columns of names and connected randomly
Or just one huge loop works too
Like Freya has Joeli who has Casper who has freya etc. Loops of two even work when people have each other
It helps to do it in a loop
That woulda been bad lol
Haha oh nooo
:(((
Oh no!!!
Need to restart now
Ended up having to give annie annie
trying to write out who gets who
I fucked up the secret santa
i feel kidna guilty about it lol
pulled out the old razzle dazzle
lmao
to be fair i poached 50% of it from two other assignments from past years that are on a simialr topic
insane
that's fucking insae
its 700 words
took about 55 minutes
i think im pretty much done
I literally did this entire assignment, that i had over a month to do, in under an hour
And it's really no problem man
Hahaha
Do it
I'm going to send it like that
thats amazing

well hopefully you can get those exams cleared quickly
damn man
Written in class exam: Dec 16
Take home exam 2: Dec 3 - Dec 17
Assignment: Tonight
Take home exam 1: Dec 5 - Dec 13
With one last report due on the 13th
My last exam is the 12th
oof
17th 😦
when are you done done?
yeah no worries man
nice, i wont be free for a little while unfortunately. Maybe tomorrow though actually, tiny break between my assignment due tonight and my exam i get given on thursday
only one last big project to finish off
Which will most likely be tomorrow
when I have a chance to play
i'm going to buy it regardless
Shon and I may have played for like 4 hours last night
oh no
no 😦
Did you guys end up buying sea of thieves discounted?
😎
B)
online
but like 6 friends
I have a couple chats

I will never leave
Hahaha
Im still in it
that was my only group chat
fuck
Hahaha
I’m scared

so they dont blow up the whole ship when hit
So people keep explosive barrels in the crows nest
https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/e59e30/watch_this_shot/
https://www.seaofthieves.com/forum/topic/49455/6-player-man-o-war-3d-model-flythough
larger parties
to not throw off the balance
there would probably have to be a game mode for larger ships
depth charges
thats why a big strategy is swimming at ships with explosive barrels underneath
oh boy
you can
which leak faster
and you can get holes in the bottom of your ship too
so i think our ship sank so fast because we shot it from above
but would be fun
might be unfair to small parties
possibly
I bet they will add larger party sizes eventually, and larger ships even, like imagine ones with cannons on the subdecks with little portholes for them
lol
the best part of chips is the crunch
No

You too
Have a good night
Thanks man
True!
Oh okay, goodluck dude!
Also gotta head to bed. Got a huge presentation tomorrow morning
i can play life is strange from home now! And I dont have to bring my PC!
True
for single player its excellent
I wish it worked better
i was too lazy to switch keyboard mouse and headphoens
so the only difference was my audio was very slightly delayed
i started watching from the PC monitor instead
They recommend wired internet
:(
i cant handle it
the delay is too much
oh god
You can see the Mac stream buffering in comparison
This is trippy

I'm just faster
I'm watching you type
Hahahahaha
You keep beating me to what I’m going to say
Yes
He’s
PC is now a server
You basically just have a gaming server
I just switch inputs on the other monitor to be on Mac
This is amazing
Haha
Yes
Yes
This way I’ll never have to interact with windows though
But it does mean you never have to use windows
Shhhh
On a single player game it wouldn’t matter too
But you could also just use the monitor attached to your computer lmao
Barely noticeable
Like
30ms
Man it’s really not bad though
That's why I've never been able to really use steam link
Yeaaaaaah
One is like 30ms behind lmao
Guyess which one is real
Hahahaha
This is ducking bizarre
But totally doable
But it'd be mildly nasty
Lmao yeah I think I mentioned that you could do that
from my mac
i can just remote play
I never have to use my new pc directly
<@!136253782131474432> oh my god nick
its getting weird
store
holy have you seen the steam page
yeah no rush
tomorrow I will deff have news!
sorry

i will let you know
Just curious about how it runs

What is that from
Where did you get that ice storm hazard thing lmao
Mu
Um
or send it off to the farm with grandma and your three hampsters 🙂
Most animals when it's time to die I'm sure I've heard take them out back or behind the barn to shoot it
<@331154975457673228>
And it getting old and sick and the boy has to take it out back and shoot him
Some story with a dog
Might be from old yeller maybe?
And needs to be put down
The behind the barn thing is for when your dog is sick
good on you for eating it

And the new firefox is great on it
yeaaah chrome is bad on ram for some reason
and when it DID have a memory leak, even if i closed chrom the leaking tab did not go away, it just froze. So like 20% of my ram was forever locked until I restarted my pc
and it has memeory leaks
I had to ditch crome when it was litteraly eating 70% of my ram with only 4 tabs open
Yes do switch to Firefox though
Take it behind the barn?
lol
I do recemend firefox its not as ram intensive
no you cant go to the farm to go see grandma. Or call her.
or "Go live on the farm with grandma"
you "send it off to the farm"
I think
when something is old you take them behind the farmhouse to shoot them?
thats a real thing right?
idiom
why cant i find reference to that idom
maybe its time to take Chrome out behind the farm
it loaded for me

thank fin
n
happy chrimbus sho
bottom left
I forgot how
Uh
if your in the "home" section its easy to find, but you just need to be there.
how to add non steam game to steam
yeah
hm
old way you had to compleatly change how you viewed your library
Its... slightyl less obscure then old way?
and you can sort by several options there
it will show all games
You have to go to lybrary > home, then scroll down under recent friend activity
hope you have space
Ok I found how to do it
43GB download
so sea of theives is like at least 50GB uncompresserd lmao
yeah i cant tell
and now its even more obscure
it was an obtuse way to sort before
we do not know the new ways
we are old now
hm
but not new steam
I know how to in old steam
how do you sort steam by file size with your libaray now
question
ok nice
before it just gave me an option to buy it
ah NOW it says install
https://www.microsoft.com/en-CA/p/sea-of-thieves-anniversary-edition/9pcd5s0dmf5z?wa=wsignin1.0&activetab=pivot:overviewtab
or windows store
idk
or just go to the website and hit install maybe
look for s undefr start menu
lol
I cant even see what im typing
its just a HUGE box overlaying everything to the bottom left of my screen
its in your start menu too
I did and clicking it add it back is making it unresponsive
didnt you disable it
help the search bar is unresponasive and it overtop of everything else
hope you have 45GB
then you open it and it downlaods
to your computer
if your microsoft account is linked
its just on your computer now
you search it in search bar
yeah I know it makes no sense lmao
now... how do I download it
Ok well I redemed the gift
what?
like
and could just use thier own phone to get into it?
yeah exactly lmao
there is a GOOD chance they have a phone
if somone took over my account
it's weird that it just accepts any phone though
but like
they think my account is succpucus or something
7756 is your code
I looked into why
No its my only option
is there no way to get around it?
that's really weird
for... some reason?
it just needs a phone number
613-206-4440
it looks like its not linking your phone to my account
*i definitely won't steal your account*
sure that works
I can give you the code if you send it to my phone
😦
what do
I dont have a currently working phone
but
I need to endter a phone number for a code
So
Ok
lmao ffs microsoft
why
microsoft pls

Cortana doesn't want you to forget about hwr
Lock the task bar! lock the task bar!
Lmao
If you right click and hit show search bar or something
WHITE BAR
and then
the whole bottom bar is a nice gradiant grey
You can make it smallee
its blinding me
like
its obnoxiously huge in the bottom left
TABLET
why is the "type to search here" so Fucking BIG!
And that dog in the windows XP search
Also
Legit its based on the same code that powered bonzi
she is the modren day bonzi buddy
I want to uninstall cortana
turned off all of her options
I think I killed her
She wants to help
she wants to listen to you 🙂
fucking cortana
gotta power cortana
And possibly
Hahaha
does windows 10 just requier 3~ or so gigs to run?
its not showing up in task manager
I cant figure out wtf is eating so much ram
I had to search ever fucking prosess to see if it needed to be running or not on windows 7
if it gives me a warning I know I cant close it, if it does not then well, guess I didnt need it open
well now I can tell what are windows critical files by just trying to close them
"wonder why that happend"
*blue screen of death*
"yea"
"Are you sure you want to end Windows.exe?"
lmao
now its like "if you do this you have to click this box agreeing to instantly restart your pc"
in windows 7 if I tried to end task them its just like "Sure ok!" and then my pc has a fucking sezier and blue screens
I noticed it wont give me the option to end task on essential windows functions any more
<:ScreenShot20191116at1:645148010812276737>
I gotta figure out wtf is eating 4 gb of ram passivly
ok so now
o7
o7
I give it a sulute
Yes
windows 7 will be missed
:/
not on this PC
and did not give me the option to set without closeing down the progam
you never had a login password?
Haha
it was actualy asking for the local password that I never set
they really want dat data
It was obnoxious
Or offline account
you have to choose to only login with a local account
they make it *really* hard to not make a microsoft account
becasue I did not have a password yet it could not accept a password
Ok so it turns out I had to make a password first but through a compleatly different page

what password is it asking for?
what
but it wont accept my new password
So ok, I guess I just enter my password again? Odd, I just changed it, why is it asking for it a 2nd time?
Next time you sign into this computer, use your Microsoft account password or Windows Hello, if you've set it up.
We'll need your current Windows password one last time.
Sign into this computer using your Microsoft account

WHOA WHOA WHOA
no matter what im doing I just see th TYPE HERE TO SEARCH!
its distracting
also the HUGE fucking white bar in the bottom left of windows is ugly as fuck
it keeps coming back when I end task it

there is so much shit running on my pc now
Like pulp fiction
Ohhhhh nice that’s really cool
https://urbigenous.net/library/nine_billion_names_of_god.html
I was thinking though of like, several fairly short storys that seem unrelated, but it turns out they are all connected. And/or the characters of one short story are side characters to a different one. Basicly each 'chapter' is a totaly different little story, and characters featured in one as main focus are just passing glance in the next chapter or something.
I’ll give an example of a great short story
I love uhhh
20 is almost like a novella though
Ok. Not too long
I’d say like min 5 pages, max like 20. Single spaced.
about how many words
like
how long is a short story?
First
not yet
Have you thought of any specifics yet?
Love your short story idea though
True
Nice
uses less ram
Setting Firefox
Then purge bing
Set chrome default
Yeah haha
Woooooo!!!!

I feel like I’m not giving great input
Maybe for setting though:  a hard winter, snowed in, gotta make it through together. Or if you want like a fantasy theme it can be like exploration or the journey home after exploration! Orrr hmm
Into*
Maybe something that touches on family, or is a metaphor. I love when values and messages seep I to the themes
So for short story ideas, hmmmm
I hope the update goes smoothly Shon
I love the oblivion memes. And I love the short story idea <@!257986741896609802>

You could upgrade to win10

Yea I dont have windows 10, im still 7 😦

there is a pice of pizza face down on his shit
the smell of musty old pizza filling the room
seeing him there sweating
I imagin just walking into his head office
Never get high on your own pizza pie
he is adictied to his own suply
He's like a dealer who only sells to fund his own usage
Though also how much he has made from pizzas
Imagine how much money this dude has spent on pizzas
"God I wish that was me"
He ate 40 pizzas in 30 days

Recordings of your voice are more true

because it feels *wrong*
no one lieks their own voice
But still
Tis but an illusion

But you have the talent of being able to do any voice
sounds mumbly and indigested
I dont like the pitch/tone of my voice
I sound so unsure of everything I say haha

10 times less democracy though
Russia has like 10 times the people
But some differences are driven by economy and culture of the nations
And with trans boundary effects across the Arctic Ocean
Also they have issues with cumulative effects
But like they all generally have issues with indigenous land claims, indigenous engagement and knowledge being included in assessment
Are shared *
Yeah sometimes conditions are true same but the arctic isn’t homogenous
they're all at the top of the globe
and why wouldn't thgey
why would challenges be shared
Yeah
Arctic maps are weird
it basically touches alaska
I knew it was close but not that close
for some reason, I never realised that russia was that close to Canada
And whether challenges are shared or unique

damn
On environmental impact assessment in the eight arctic states
Stress is building though

The average humans penis (5.16") takes about two tablespoons of blood to become erect. Coincidentally, Hamsters have about two tablespoons of blood total. I would like to propose that we measure penis size not by inches, but by how many Hamsters it takes to become erect.
I thought u could make it big

A really broken socialist country
That sounds like
A perfect utopia! everyone loved me!
Meanwhile the rich live me and help fund new programs
The people who managed to become middle class imedietly lose everything that then goes back into the economy to help the poor. When they are poor their money they just lost now goes to helping them live well.
then I tax the every loving SHIT out of the middle class. This way when the poor finnaly become middle class, they are taxed so hard they become poor again
Then give the poor a whole fuck tone of support so they have like free everything
Give a shit ton of tax breaks to the rich, so they get mega rich, and what few taxes they pay are worth a lot.
Or just do what I did in that geo political game where you have to manage a countrys people to stay voted in
lmao true

Boss: Zinthow
Secrets: All past primary bosses may be fought, supercharged and in new environment; killing them will remove them from next run (but not runs after that) (Will anger Zinthow, giving him generic dialogue and preventing acquiring Reaper on that run. Reaching Zinthow with Knight and NOT attacking any of his children in the tower will result in the possibility of unlocking Reaper if the correct dialogue is chosen. Killing Zinthow without taking a hit will result in the hidden boss fight, Zinthow’s True Form, to occur.

So in reality I still have 173.5% of course marks due, so almost two entire courses to complete in one month
95%
But that’s another 90%
Then I have three take home exams but like 2 weeks to do them
78.5
Actually I forgot to add 5% onto that
73.5%
30+1+15+17.5+10% of course marks due in next 7 days
I’m about to be absolutely destroyed this week
And that’s why I got a 70 on my last test
I bet I’ve spent more time on my stupid cross word app than I have studying for tests this semester

I think in final semester everyone just gets tired
yeah nobody goes to my classes anymore
and noone goes
lmao
its because class is at 8:30 am
its about making an effort
You have to answer a question, but even if youre wrong you get the grade stull
that shouldn't be allowed
THAT SSO MUCH
GRADE
but worth 25% OF THE COURSE GADE
that's starnge
exactly
Is it like a random attendance grade?
that still leaves me with 80% on them though
lmao
5% of the course grade
ive missed TWO of them
and i still miss class
i get 2.5% ten times randomly selected in classes, FOR FREE
it's at 8am
thats hilarious
hahahah
I've only got one class I need to go to per week and i've skipped the past three lol
yeah..
hopefully not as bad as mine
not sure how that'll affect my grade
i've been skipping most of the discussion boards so no marks have appeared for them
they suck
also idk what's happening with my geneds lol
ah damn
but there's no grades for it yet
something always gets shafted
that sucks
I've barely done anything for it
lol
except for this beap bullshit
nice
lol
somehow that's what i'm at in this semester
glory days
I got four A+s and one A one semester
yeah it probably is
maybe that's adding to your stress
hahah yeah
I want to earn money by programming, not spend it
and yet when I didnt even know about the 80% requirement for masters, I got a 94% average one semester lmfao
I just want to be done so much
same
this is literally my last month of school and for some reason I have so few shits to give about schoolwork lmao
it's really dumb
yeah
way too much effort
of the course grade
out of 0.9%
thats 0.7%
so fuck that
85 on the other
Haha
yeah same basically
I got a 70 on one lol
lmao
out of 11
Ive only done it twice
I have to go and comment on three other people's things adding to the discussion
my posts are marked
Same
Sam
mine i'm not even able to get full marks by just posting
but the discussion has to be about the reading
To be fair you can just scroll to the end and click to say youve read it
Theres no way im doing it
wtf
SSame
You need to complete 40 pages of reading in order to be allowed to psot too
I just rememberd I have to do one by 12 tonight
yes
they are a cancer to college/uni
I hate them
and i get 70s on every assignment
fuck those fucking discussion posts
they are worth 10% of the grade
Because I didnt do any of the weekly discussion posts
I might even have a mid 60 in one class 😦
I think I have like 70s in 2/4 of my classes. Low 80s in a third, and mid 80s in the fourth
how are you doing in the class besides that
ahhhh
i need an 80 average to get into my masters program
better then 20 🙂

I've been waiting at baseline station for the 88 freezing to death for fucking half an hour

and yeah i heard nick
I was just watching the office today randomly shon

the salad cat is from ottawa
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/smudge-cat-instagram-ottawa-1.5359199?__vfz=medium%3Dsharebar
i hate it
with me being in the poster
i was required to make this
like 100%
my course is literally just re-living comptec
at least thats how I interperate that MC song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujJQyhB0dws
thats what that song is
you can remeber them but you cannot expierence them again.
no matter how much you want, or try, its over. its dome
you cant expierence them again
but you know those times are gone
explore and do what you wish
when you could just enjoy yourself
carefree times
of happy times
it reminds you of past times
nostalgia
and
melancholy
Why does this song make me kinda sad: https://open.spotify.com/track/4NsPgRYUdHu2Q5JRNgXYU5?si=BfRKH4XZQDeH-e6pnacPMQ

This grown ass man


lol

we had a nice chat
i went to house of georgie with him
food
ive only seen one homeless guy be happy for fod
yep
lol
Those that beg for money wanting drugs, saying food, when you give them food they get sad or pissed. "I wanted money for food! I did not want food! Dont cut out the middle man!"
they can go to the soup kitchen for food
they hate receiving food lol
Its an unfortunate reality
yeah
most of them
because some of them will use money for drugs.
you should never give beggers money, buy them food
:( I'm sure he appreciated pizza
I remeber hearing that
Also
I know nick. Not much you two can do; I just remain hopefull that the stars alien
he seemed really upset about it
and he was like "Okay :(" and sadly accepted half a pizza slice
and I was like "All I have is literally the pizza in my hand"
and he said "Its cheaper if you give me money i can use at dollarama"
I said I dont have change but I have food
sorry he said: can i have change for food
he was like "can I have change"
and he was sad about it
I just gave a homeless man half a slice of pizza pizza
soon there will be endless time for D&D

it couldnt really follow

I just saved 30mins
I guess it keeps your attention more

It’s not good.
I love heat
I want that
damn
We can’t control the temperature. It’s even hotter then summer 😦
They must have the heat cranked to god damn 40 or something
I have the window wide open to let cool air in, a fan blowing on me, and I’m sweating to death and the air almost feels hard to breath due to the heat
My apartment is so fucking hot
At least you're close
Jesus

From now until Dec 17 is going to really suck
😐
you probably will
Wonder if i'll have to wait another 19 days
Wish I had a confirmation still
Awesome! Yeah goverment is so fucking slow
19 days since the interview
```
Just so you are aware, we are still consulting  with HR to clarify the options available to us for hiring you over the course of the winter/summer months. I’m sorry we don’t have any further confirmations to share just yet, but we hope to have some news within the coming week.```
NIck you were right

My phone does too

thanks
And yeah I noticed
Nice
lol
Did I do good
And sometimes my phone suggests news
But to sum it up I get my news from Reddit
Mods are literal nazis
/r/Canada is weirdly alt-right
I get my news from /r/worldnews, /r/news, /r/onguardforthee, /r/Ontario, /r/canadapolitics and /r/ottawa
They apologized and said it was a mistake
BBC showed a wreath laying of Boris Johnson from last year because he fucked this year's up by placing it upsidedown
Uuuuuh
<@!136253782131474432>

I think its jsut hard to do with class sizes of 200
Oh wow thats awesome

All my professors generally work one on one with people and talk to them
I think you guys just get very cold professors
Oh! Then you're lucky haha
All my profs talk to each other
Animation was different where all the class profs talked to each other
You'll find that soon :)
They do not care if they stack due dates do they?
Holy fuck

Very specific wording of mechanics
and they are all technical in the way they work
Honestly magic items are the most
Every magic item, major plot idea, puzzles, and refrences to things
Its like
Yea
Is that like all of the story we're playing through
that's a lot of words jesus
oh man
Thats over a long ass time
MIND YOU this is not dont in like a night like you did!

This is my google Doc for DnD
Found it.
keep it up
But yea Good job <@!331154975457673228> !
for google docs
how do you do that work count check fin
Speaking of
That makes me think of my google doc for DnD

Jesus
this isnt even the essay


I gotta balance all this stuff to make sure a creature is not too overturned for its intended pourpose
If a player deals on avrage Z amount of damage, But only if they roll X, with their modifier of Y, and the creature has a hit pool of Q, how many turns will it take to kill it?
you will go down this rabbit hole and waste hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SacogDL_4JU&t=3s
Also
Like what is the probobility of reaching X with a 1d20, when you have a bonus modifier of Y; now, whats Advantage and Disadvantage (roll twice) change those odds
so great
watch all of CaryKh's videos on his mahcine learning projects at stanford
machine learning baby
its all ABOUT statistics
naaaaah
I do DnD
statistics are awesome
I know statsitics
so fun
I have tried
machine learning is mostly statistics
Once you get into parlabulas I just cant do it
they only prgramming that interests me is machine learning
Aldurabra and lower math
I did have to take calculus tbh
Basicly
Im great at Gr. 9 and lower
Uh
which
you needed to take math
to take past the basic courses
My neural net caught no brain fish nick
I know at Uni
Oh that was something too
That's only if you want to design algorithms
you don't have to be good at math
you can be
but I was never good at it
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine
GOOD LUCK FIN
I know ive always kinda wanted to get into Programing cuz I forsaw it being a money maker
seeya
one page left
okay bye guys
also nick that sounds cool
yea
to draw more atention
we got it for free
I think they did it as a rebranding
so they dont even profit
BIZARRE
weird
nice
oh
my past stupid self bough it
It was free for anyone who owned the first I think
somehow
you own the later
or a free update
BUT
I agree
yeah shoulda just been DLC
It killed the game
forreal
I cant awnser that, but I know the PA devs are known for shitty moves in the past. BUT they have stuck to the game and are still updating it which impresses me
should just be DLC if anything
sounds like an overwatch 2 move
why make a whole new game to add a few units
my last assignment was designing a finite state machine in a QNX VM split into three programs that spoke to each other using interprocess communication
just more
its the same game
it just adds super units
but
why not launch PA:T instead
but it seems dumb
yes
But you own PA:T
but not PA:T
I saw you launched PA
```python
if:
    if:
        if:
            if:
```
Also fin
but it could be done
because of how many if then or else statments
nested if statements
it would run like *ass*
I could program a lot with just if statments
it sucks
hey programming can honestly suck penis juice
and I mean
But yea my problem has always been I cant seem to get past the If statments
lmao
It wasn't working and I was like "maybe i'm doing it wrong"
yes lmfao
dont you just type 'break'
"{If x, Then- ;
Else- ;
}
lmao
Did you know that the cloud ops networking environment has a security DDOS uplink requirement to require the assembly legacy object oriented languages to send packets to be decrypted by the data libraries in the assembly binary environment?
Thats just
Which is like the most basic thing
I googled how to break out of a loop at work today
and like
yeah, programming is 99% googling how to do basic things though
Every time I have tried to learn past an If Statment, it goes in one ear and out the other
I know the basic idea of the computers thoughts- I know how it thinks. Ive never had the problem of "My code says this, why is it not doing this! I want it to do this, but how do I make it think that way!"
My problem is always "I dont know any key phrases past an If Statment"
Haha
in grade 11
I want more people to talk about my field with
when i got to the function section of js and i couldnt do it
that is
programing
i rememebr you were so disappointed in me nick
It's why i'm stuck in two gened classes right now
I have always had a problem with Com Sci
also i've done that
But
That's how I learned
Com Sci drew the short stick
Both of you do codecademy
yes!
now that i understand what a function is
It was mostly due to I was overloaded and I figured I did not have enough time to study all the courses I had, so I intentionaly stoped studding one to make room for the others
Maybe some day I should do codecademy again
but
I failed
It was something I took
were you minoring in cs?
That was Uni
But I like it
C++ is hard
lmao
syntax
Everything from Adobe flash, to visual basic, to java, to java scrip, to C++
there

pls meme
thats a coding language
But once you know one, they're all kind of the same
so you know dank memer right
it's the same at algonquin
yes
I had to learn a new language
but every year when I learend took it
I understand the basics
lol
So like
Its rough 2 times better than anything ive ever owned
You have more than me fin
Som Cci
I love nicks ccomputer
I have 12GB
anyway
I dont have the ram to spare
Haha
if anything is hogging more ram then it should it gets killed,.
GPUs are black magic processors designed for graphics
Yea my PC I have Task manager open 24/7 to watch for leaks
love that
true
ture
trye
Oh yeah
So your progarm continues to hog it even when it's not beingused
all the other physical parts of a PC I get mixed up on
memory leaks are when you're writing in a language like C where you have to manage memory on your own but you forget to free it once you're done
Physicly, I know ram and only ram
keeps caching logs until it uses up all your random access memory
Yea, Im fairaly good at understanding ram. Its like the only part of a PC I can understand
and it feels like a field you could do well in
Sometimes chrome keeps doing a processes over and over forever, and does whats called a memory leak
it's like mad money in three years if you can do it
Random access memeory baby
And things get real slow
Chrome has to store data like tab names, page caches and stuff somewhere so it puts it in ram which is really quick to load from. If you run out of ram, it has to wait for other programs to finish before it can save any data
Anyway, Com Sci: I took it every single year in high school, and I took it in the only year of Uni I was in
If you want a slightly more better explanation
GPU is more like how complex of graphics you can render
Basically what ram is is where programs store temporary data
Ok, thanks
Ram is stability
Love that
Brianna's is actually Kurt's old one lol
Okay nice
And I see, so GPU effects FPS.
yours is my old one haha
Mine is like 7000 range
Yes, it tests it on a bunch of things and gives it one number
my new gpu has a benchmark of 11377
a way to normalise each GPU's performance against each other
thought it related to something
Ah, arbitrary
Arbitraty ranking
And fun fact about Com Sci
but, I dont get what the numbers mean
Well I see that
my old one
your GPU is like having 1/6th of nicks
Like
Oof
What does "6065" and "986" mean
shon random question, would you ever want to go into computer science
The amd radeon hd 6800 had a benchmark of 986
Ive played onesingle player game of PA actually
It had a benchmark of 6065
I havent even used my new computer yet 😦
I upgraded my GPU two years ago because I couldn't play games on ultra anymore
1 page left
What resolution/graphics level you can play on
GPU affects the fps you get in games
Also, how percicely does it effect gaming?
I know ram effects loading time, and if I use up all my ram it stutters and slows down the game, even freezes. How does GUP play into things?
thanks bot
It's been one second
One sec
0 out of 10?
Like, 1 out of 10, 3 out of 10?
hah
Really bad :(
Its
AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series

Oh, can you click display adapters
What do you need me to open
There

Ok one second
if first, how do I find it
Open up device manager and send a screenshot of that
Wait, did the thing I send not have the info, or just you never heard of it
I actually don't know what you have
The GPU (graphics card) effects everything about games. It's the most expensive and most important part
So, how does that impact things.
The biggest most major factor is your graphics card
haha, I can feel the lacking ram when I play new games
16gb is recommended for modern games but 8gb is sufficient I just ran out of money while upgrading haha
The ram is good enough, I have the same amount right now although I need to double it
Well, the CPU isnt the worst, like it benchmarks as around 1/3rd the score of my brand new one
is there 1 perticularaly lacking part, or is it all just bad,
I dont know computer stats
So whats particularly bad about it
Haha
Today... My company was throwing out a computer that's better than it
On a scale on 1-10, what would it have been 10 years ago, 5 years ago, and today.
10 years ago it was really good
Well
And
I should be down to do anything tomorrow!
and how does it compare to todays day
how good would they have been 10 years ago
Earlier I showed my PC stats
Oh nick
also, Sound on: https://i.imgur.com/qQrpip7.mp4
or it could just be another day off
Oui nick
If dnd is unavalible tomorrow, would it be a good hang out day instead? perhaps zombois, starrelms, or something else?
Owoh no
awful
Oh no

Hahaha some extra towards it would be awesome but you've definitely earned yourself some slices
Once I got things settled I could even chip in for pizza! Or, I could still be exumped, as prep work is my 'payment' :p
haha yea
No more broke boiy hours
any income would be fantastic
Yeah!
Which, if it leads to work, would be great
That's awesome dude! I hope you get it
all I know is I need to bring my resumue
My Ontario Works guy got me hooked up with something- possibly
Eh kinda
Oh, are you planning on applying some places?
Is that ok? if not ill find another way
I remeber of our group you have a printer
I need my resumue printed off, if that would be alright
Ok so <@!331154975457673228> I need assistance
hold on I might have a reuqest for fin but I dont think so
OH!
Hm that's true
I argued the second is more scary because that person, if able to keep up with you (as your on your own two feet as well) must be physicly fit enough to run with a bike in tow and must be all sorts of messed up.
<@331154975457673228> was there
They were just screaming
Except they weren't chasing me
Also that happened downtown once
The first one because it's coming faster
this is a question I need everyones opinion on.
or a person, running towards you screaming, carying a bike in their arms, with the same intnet to cause you harm as the previous individual
A person, biking towards you screaming, likely with the intenet to cause you harm
What would be more frightning?
A question came out
and
Tyler and I had a discusion
Only where you've gotten on and transferred at
But yes you can't see where you get off
Ah alright.
There is, you can see your own history
Also I guess they would only be able to see where you got ON a buss, not off.
I wonder if there is a system in place to actualy read off where the card has been. Like sure it reads it, sees if its paid recently or not, but im wondering if there is a recorded database somewhere with logs of each specific card.
But yes paper cash has no paper trail haha
Yes
Bus to enemies house > bus to shovel store > bus to middle of nowhere
Ironicly, cash, litteral paper, leaves no paper trail.
people know where I've been
the only problem with the card is it leaves a paper trail
Lmao
Probobly goverment servalancew
Idk how to even do that
Rather than having to get a ticket thing
Also your transfer is tracked by the card if you need to
Ok
It's only $3.50 rather thAn $3.60 haha
How much is Buss fare right now btw
Also you get a discount on the fare
Yea I guess that would be convinent
You can buy one at lobbylaws
If you get one for $5 then you can just top it up with your debit
Get a presto pass
and im not sure how much I will need. But I need at least a few trips.
Right
Ahhh
Im not 100% sure, I dont really need cash, per say, I need to turn my money into something to use for buss fare
aparently all the reviews say its not
How much cash do you need
but
It says its a Presedence coice one
It does
Loblaws might have one
That's weird
Lmao
90% of them have 1 star lol
you can review them and everyone gives a shit star
Im looking up atms online on google maps and
geeze
Are there any within walking distance
Hum
The ATMS are always open
Right at the front of BMO
Ya'll good for DND tomorrow?
Also
where would that ATM be nick
idk
does not like rodgers or RBC
it like
Lil'K does not have one I can use
Or hell the macs probably does too
Yes BMO has them then
just need an atm somewhere
Im with RBC
Hum
Well, money from my bank account to cash
Phone money? BMO can do it for like a $3 charge unless you're with BMO
where is the closest universal ATM
I need to convert money from my phone into cash
nearing 11
PC is 10 years old
and yea

I do not know if thats good or bad
also wtf
2009 release date
oh man, that's literally the first generation of an i7 lmao
and Fix is red
Its really hard to tell but see how "It" at the top is blue

Here is a shity phone photo that kinda shows off blurry text
Also
That it <@!136253782131474432>

"about my PC is not there
thats not an option
uh
right click on "my computer"
how do I open that
whatever huge bulky cord I was using
from...
also I know I had to switch to an HDMI cord
and send a screenshot
open "about this PC"
How do I check
Uh
It was fine before I swtiched monitors
shon what are your computer specs
Or it could be a dying graphics card 🙂
It could be the wire too
Yea
it's not blurry in the screenshot
im like 90% sure its a screen problem and therefor a screenshot wont capture it
I dont think that will work
https://imgur.com/pL21ViL
Im not sure why everything is blury
Its not a resulution problem. Everything has been set to default to fix
It is kinda highlighted blue, and the I in fix is redish
like in my above statment "I manged to fix it with a different monitor"
there are little blue and red smudges on text
this is most notible with text
Everything is kinda blury
I have a new problem
now
but
tyler had a spare
I manged to fix it with a different monitor
Do you want a new monitor, I have extras
Lmao that's so bad
poor shon
thats awful
lol
and oh no shon
oh damn that sucks about the tetras 😦
huh so if you take a slow mo video and edit it in any way imgur thinks you deleted it when you try to upload it
But every time I try to upload to imgur imgur crashes
So I found out I can just remove the slo-mo after filming in slow mo
That’s what my pc does
https://i.imgur.com/JuxYjqo.mp4
So if you double the speed of this
I saw I could take a video in slow motion
BUT THEN
So you can’t really see it
Almost syncs
https://i.imgur.com/XXAqVQZ.mp4
It flickers so fast it syncs with my refresh rate
But well
Well, it’s happening rn and I thought I’d take a video of it
You know how I told you guys about my screen flickering right?
Hey so

Domestic abuse
anytime she tries to leave the males tail swipe her back into her place
the female tetra hasn't been able to leave the one corner of the tank since they got added
fin how do we get two male tetras to stop bullying a female tetra <@!331154975457673228>
I thoughyt that to

But nobody believed it because of how stupid that'd be

because I was having that issue
Did you copy it from a powerpoint
why is this text an image

i did not realise
this assignment due at midnight is like 20 pages
nice
lol
This guy at Algonquin just has a hat with the word "fuck"
thats awful
awww nooooo
like rooster fighting
people bet on them 😦
like its very very difficult
cannot have 2 males together
you basically like
males are bad for fighting i think
ok nice
guy at petsmart said two should be ok with the glofish
females can be a little agressive but they can live together in sororities pretty happily
Love those names
Males
Do female betas fight or just makes?
and their names are alice and wonderland
gonna add the others later
sO we got our 2 female bettas for the tank
I was super tired
I went to bed at 9:30 haha
Yes but I meant to
That sucks did you actually
And yes I woke up at 6:30 with no reason to
I fucking love that fin
Unprecedented for me
Also proud of how early everyone in chat is awake
-8 Sunday 😦
But every once and a while my computer thinks it still is
This hasn’t been my background for weeks

yess
I like LEGO
nooooooo
Jimbo, blimbo, and bumpo
what do you think of the name lego
shh no more fight
But it was accidentally not bad
now help me pkck some names
Glofish themselves: not bad
i hope the day of rekoning is caused my my glofish
I’m against marketing spliced animals before extensive environmental scale research. Which thankfully is most countries stances as well, other than many of the states and like India
I’m pro gmos that have a substantial reward to society that have been through the very long legal and scientific deliberation across the world to be allowed out there. I’m pro cloning, pro artificial selection, pro buying local, pro aquarium, and pro innovation and research
My stance: highly regulated and well thought out genetic modification, using the precautionary principle
Not against cloning
kenyas fucked up enough she probably already is a clone
please
clone my cat
more spliced shit
more glofish
and honestly im up for it
Didn’t say it was, said it starts a legal precedent for more organism to be on the market
where they die because they are not,,,, saltwater fish
like me buying glofish isnt putting them in the ocean
Biproducts are still products
and honestly not really
doesnt mean we need to stop selling grapes it means we need to becareful but trial and error
You must understand my point by now
its a biproduct it happens
i mean no one says lets take all these spiders put them in all these grapes
Just research it
Okay then why pack more metaphorical spiders into more metaphorical grapes then
maybe not like
transparent frogs that are created do exist
i mean theyve been on this sort of thing for a while like
They do not do environmental scale research
I’m literally saying that they need to be studied more before being allows to be marketed or become widespread
yeah but that same thing can happen if a spider crawls in a bag of grapes
Which killed every chestnut in North America
not the cause but a symptom
Which caused the chestnut blight
its like
They said the same thing about ornamental chestnut trees from Asia
thats not an issue of splicing though thats always been an issue
If they exist they will end up there
But they end up there
but thats the thing theyre not meant to be in the wild
All I’m saying is that it should be studied highly and regulated
Maybe... depends on if the transparent frogs do something unexpected like attract more chytrid fungus which then expands the fungus population so much that the native frogs end up dying
i have no qualms making frogs transparent so we can look inside of them rather than cut them open
I have no qualms with artificial selection, literally all animal husbandry and crops we ear were selected for this way
Splicing can pull from any organism
Yeah exactly
its like selective breeding
But occurs over much larger time scales which ensures you’re working with parts of the genome that are naturally present and viable within a population
love it
I should say
Artificial selextion*
That’s natural selection once again
its good
l like it when my watermelon has five giant seeds
So it should just be highly tested and regulated
It can also make them outcompete with native ones, or distract bees from other crops, despite theirs having no reward, or can be used to make the crop seeds sterile to force farmers to buy new seeds every year, etc
Make them more resistant to pests
Make crop yield higher
Make tomato’s larger
But GMO can do similar things
I Mean that’s not necessarily GMO that’s natural selection
i like my banana being 80% giant seed
Although there’s an entire type of GMO crop that are straight fucked though for no good reason
Can be pretty beneficial especially when they reduce pesticide load
Ok just wanted to clarify haha
I talked about that above
No
Do you dislike GMO foods too?
Duck it’s cold
They weren’t fully on that train yet either
not sure tho
maybe
Maaaaaybe black people
Mayyyyybe women deserve jobs too
that was pretty good
Haha
hold your baby sometimes
they started telling u maybe u should like
well
Name one thing in the 60s that wasn’t  fucked
Science in the 60s
like most monkeys in sanctuaries are from being pets
truely horrible
awful
50 bags of dead monkeys? smells like science
Pet monkeys suck
bring back the monkey shit we used to do
more science make a fish with 4 legs next
they exist solely to be an aquarium fish and maybe morally thats wrong to but eh
because like glofish having no real interaction with the outside world seems like totally fine to me
but i think really that should come down to teaching people REALLY dont put aquarium fish out into the wild
But obviously varying degrees
Non evolved traits in an environment are always a bad time, from invasives to Monsanto crops, to even cats and dogs
But some places like Scandinavia still regulate it without research done before hand which is nice
Most experimental trials were done after they were found in the environment and there were like uh oh
I mean they got pretty lucky
as far as i can tell
theyre not being willy nilly with it
zebra daniel, tetra, and another one now
they only have like 3 types of fish that carry this gene
how much shit can get tossed out
which limits like
i think the way glofish exist is safe because theyve been around for YEARS and they dont let anyone else breed them
I’m talking about the legal precedent
and died
most of which couldnt handle it
Yeah that’s worse obviously but different
before they were literally injecting fish with dye
i dont see that due to their background but i really dont want to argue
Whereas I see it as a huge lean into a slippery slope of corporate uncareful genome modification, a sector which needs to be more highly regulated and studied before things can be sold
i think theyre really cool
i dont want to look at them and feel guilty
i just wasnt looking to have the piss taken out of my tank because i genuinly like and see no real issue with glofish
Obviously
You’re allowed to be excited about it
Anyways, don’t let me opinion make you any less exited
ah you tore her from her coral home in the ocean to live in this pet store
where did u get this angel fish exactly?
Agree
uuuh
and not always ethically like
Heater
True
well tropicals are very difficult to care for
I would avoid getting tropicals too
Although I wouldn’t do a lot of things
Just saying I wouldn’t
thats just taking the piss out of everything
Never said you can’t get them
Not a lecture, just an opinion
let me get glofish and dont lecture about the morality of it unprompted
I hope it goes very well
so just like
ok
I watch aquarium videos to fall asleep
okay
I’m very excited about your aquarium
i just want to be excited about my fish fin
People dont tend to
ok cool
i dont need or want a lecture
Just said it’s pretty necessary and marginal as a product
let me be excited about my fish
ok
so heres a humane relatively low risk way of getting them
Never said that
These aren’t in humane or awful
its marketed because people want it and will do it anyway
there was a marketnfor fish like this the way people got them was inhumane and awful they made the fish anyway and said hey people want fish like this this isnt hurting or killing the fish
Go ahead, they don’t have a low quality of life as far as scientists know, and they are outcompetes by wild types in the environment, so as I said, low risk. Just saying they are among a group of biotech products marketed they can be very dangerous for absolutely no good reason
im not somehow a horrible person for getting a fish?
still getting my glofish like?
ok lol
okay but a gold fish can literally fuck up an ecosystem and its just a goldfish
Like the risk is not worth the reward is what I’m saying. Nature is beautiful enough that you don’t need to fuck with the genome to make it cooler
I’m talking about invasive
theyre tetras
I’m not talking about them
theyre not tropical
Also tropical fish can’t live in northern hemisphere anyways so it doesn’t matter
or dont put your gold fish in the lake by your house
Then buy native non spliced organism
and not to mention literally any fish released into the enviornment its not supposed to be in fucks shitnup
You’re changing the gene pool
Spliced organisms have a range of ecological implications
That doesn’t change my point
I’m very aware
they just sell them because people want them
I know
Yeah
.... they were created to find pollution in water
Honestly do you need a glowing fish so much that you need to risk ecological effects of them getting into the environment, are normal natural species not cool enough?
plus glofish doesnt allow anyone else to breed glofish
But you have to be careful, especially with animals
Food GMOs can be beneficial when done properly, like resistant to pests and stuff which reduces pesticide use
like u really want ur watermelon with big fat nasty seeds be my guest
i dont dislike gmos like i have literally no issue with it
Something worse existing doesn’t make GMO any better though
Okay sure
and its much more ethical how glofish are created than how painted fish are created
but there was a market for fish like this
Yeah I’m aware of that
i mean they were never created with the intent to be sold
It just sets a precedent for legal spliced organism market and they can really mess stuff up
personally i dont see anything really all that wrong with it
i mean depends on ur opinion on it
Doesn’t make splicing ethical though
Well yeah I know that
Basically glofish as a company sucks a bit but the fish themselves seem fine
But like your not supposed to release aquarium fish into the environment anyway
Like it wasn't made to be sold initially and was made like FOR the environment , so I think they're pretty safe
Are awful and most fish die from the process, but glofish are born with their colour
According to this thing I'm watching it's more like they spliced it and it doesn't badly affect the life of the fish, PAINTED FISH however
Apparently they were originally created to discover pollution in water
Very Low ecological risk but sets the precedent for other gmo nonfoods that could really fuck shit up in the environment and or lead to horrible quality of life for the animal that can’t even be really fully detected or understood properly. I don’t think glofish themselves suffer at all from having sea anemone DNA though
Anemone
Gave them genes from sea anenomes
Medium low ethical
Lol aren’t those GMO
"Gone. Reduced to atoms"

NIck this is my new favourite computer and keyboard
OW2 is for you then
Well
I.. want some fucking story for this game
and there is cross play
but if new heros come to 2, they also join 1
if you want single player/story, you need OW2
If you only care about multiplayer OW1 is fine
its a money grab
BASICLY
but new heros are still coming to OW1
And yea OW2 is a new game
its so good
BITCH QUEEN
Watch it nick
Lilith is bitch queen
oOOOOOOH BABY

She is a GODESS
Lilith is great
and yes
still kinda stupid its called "2"
So other then stroy, everything new in 2 will be in the first
and multiplayer stuff
but also have single player adventures and stroy
I LOVEEEEE HERRRRR
which will have everything 1 will have
I LOVE HER
but you can buy overwatch 2

<@!294754564261806081> why
Reddit is getting weird and tracky now too?

How does it play stuff ? Good
I like game
Game is very good
Game is good
You can Finnaly game
Nice
I can play games
Yes
Shon
Nice. Finnaly the gaming market is open
Oh man you got a pc
<@!331154975457673228>
You ping me
Hello
Haha happy dia de la morte :)
its like christmas
in my life
I have never been able to run games before
Its the best thing since sliced bread
Yay! How do you like it
Yes!
Yeas!
Did u get your computer <@331154975457673228>
<@!257986741896609802> shoooooonnnnnnn
thatd be reallky nasty
you don't think I should get it in a large print and hang it on my wall?
I don’t recommend
Lmao
thoughts on me getting this print?
I’m sad
:’(
I still haven’t heard back from my job interview 😦
a tripple
Oh baby
Guys it's out

Lan Ho!
Captain! I see lan in the distance!
Lan Ho!
unban the lan
I’m so down for a lan
Now that my internet should be able to actually handle it lmao
Yes
days*
likwe thwe good iold dats
yes
I have the space for like 5 computers
Once we're on christmas break or after gruduation I want to host a lan party
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEWtZmgU8AAE8IW.jpg:large
and dumb + dumb =/= smart
since we suck
thatd be fair
thats thats what i was thinkin
its just you guys can multitask better (two of you)
then eco is the same
as the one I spawn on
you two spawn on the same planet with the same number of recorces
UNLESS
still if we are on different planets it probobly means that you guys WILL have double my eco
Eh maybe
Spawn on didfeeent planets
and if I cant be agressive back, you two will, even if you play porly, have at LEAST 160% of my eco
If the two of you use any early agression its over for me
Eh
Would keep it intersting
I think it would be an even match me and nick v you
but its restricted to the sea :/
A ship so great it can lay waste to entier armies before it
my fav is the mighty LEVIATHAN
But yea it was a neat game. They added Titans to it; super units that are costly but powerful
Same I have horrendous APM
I think I just have a step up with knowledge but my APM is dogshit
And nick and I got eliminated so fast
im not too great at those games either
Pretty sure nick and I were allies once against You by yourself and kurt by himself
I think I would be screwed
Hah
Nick and I were thinking maybe we could do a 2v1 sometime (me and nick vs you) and still lose
it wasnt enough
and a swarm a black spiders came flying out
i nuked your spider bots
and you watched it turn on
using a satellite
and just built a portal
and teleported a million of them
then found your plannet
and built NOTHING but spider bots
I think it was with you
I took over a planet
I loved that one moment
I cant mamage multiple planets at once
I found it useful to set thme to potrol an area, and if they got attacked, command them to all attack the attacker manual
Such a multitasking heavy game
Spider bots work better in swarms tho
Hah
then patroling spider bots cant fuck it up
So I could select all my current millitary and just tell them to follow the one unit
yeah instead of having a bunch of single exposed vulnerable bots everywhere, itd be so OP to have a group of factory bots with military protection
Units too
does that have to be for a factory or can you set a point for a unit too
But yea I would have a lot of factory bots follow the lead factory bot to speed up production
oh interesting
I think you just have to set the rally point to a constructer, via right lcick it
I know I would have one constuter do all the stuff, then have a factory only build consiteucters, and tell them to "follow" that one main constructed my setting their rally point it
that would be nice to know how to do
as it built metal extractors
Get a military unit to follow your constructor bot around
Also stuff like
but yea
i forgot
and it would repeate the comand
It was like shift click or something
Uh
but I dont know any of the commands to automate stuff or even make units do special things really
Set a factory to auto-produce spider bots which then patrol the entire planet
Like:
I think a big part of success is knowing how to do cheesy stuff
SPIDER
BOTS
I do
Yes
Shon do you remember anythign about Plannetary Annhilation
oh no

so much rng bullshit
Crystal is theh ardest
Oh
in FTL the other day
Also I was really mad, I completed the slug cruiser unlock quest, which is really hard, *-in the slug cruiser-*.
*maniacle cackle*
What do you mean by that
And neat!
I did it!
it was me.
oh it was no bird
I might be able to play some games with you and nick
and told me that somday, maybe soono
A little bird whispered in the wind to me
Shon
Ah. Well, at least there was a heads up this time
nfortunately not
no DnD tomorrow because of All Hollows Eve correct?
So uh just a double check
Hmmmmmmmm
and risks to public and environmental health in the long term are high
that money and time to implement is worse

interesting perspective though:
wow the bruce nuclear reactor in ontario would power half of new york city
...that he did...
that he did
being goldfish]
... he died doing what he loved
it was a goldfish
he jumped
but
I have no idea
did he want to die
....
he made a huge jump to make it
and there was like an inch gap from the water to the top of air
otherwise the top of its encvlosher was covered
Yea. The hole it jumped out of was just as big as it
thats so terrible poor fish
after I found him
thats basicly what he looked like
what a way to go
a dried up carrot
😦
I thought it was a dried up carrot 😦
when I found it
Your poor fish
Also oh no
Love that
I woke up and watched the first IT thismornuing
Hah
Today I just woke up
Yesterday I woke up at 7
I try and go to bed by 11 most nights but wake up at random times
Right now my sleep schedule is weird
I like getting up early but I have to sleep consistently or else it's near impossible
Yea, I dont feel I will be getting up that early permemently
it commited suiside by jumping out of 1 inch hole 😦
Whoa I don't even get up that early
reminds me of the time I had a gold fish
And fish can be cool
In bed at 11:00, up at around 5-6
I recently fixed my sleep scedual
Nick and I wanna get some glofish
Hah yes
Yeah a couple fish!
everyone loves the cucumber
oh!
do no fish live in there? 😦 i like the ones with fish
love those!!!!

In your submission you will need to address the following:

 

1. Purchase prices of each item.
2. Brand name, Model Number, Picture of each item.
3. Expected yearly energy use of each item.
4. Expected yearly operating cost of each item (note that, in order to
   determine this amount, you will first have to determine what type of
   energy your new home will be using from “Part C”.
5. What are your reasons for these choices?
expensive things*
If it's expensive it has to be green right?
I'm just choosing the most expensive thing on best buy
It's painful
And fucking hell
And its electricity use

the wifi card started to die
one of my computers problems it picked up over the years
if I dont hook into the modem I lose internet for 7.5 seconds every 5:30 mins
Yea its nice
oh i'm jealous
cables
ethernet
we are both physicly hooked into the modem
Oh no?
and I know tyler and I are not wifi
"eh"
so I was like
was looking, most provoides I saw going from 1 gb/s to 500 mb/s only reduced the cost by 5$
yea
Most wifi cards can't support that high
Honestly you probably don't even need 1Gbps
Damn yeah you definitely can
so I know we can reduce it
but I know its over 100 right now
im not 100% sure
uhh
Oh damn what are you paying?
Its a good consideration tho! We are looking to reduce, so anything we can use to say to rodgers as leverage is useful
1 gb/s
What do you have now?
And I believe it's 75Mbps
$65 after 6 months but once you get one of those deals you can usually switch around and keep getting better deals
thats temporary, and how much does it provoide
Fido has internet now for a really good price

Niiiick
yes?
Nick
I understand what you mean. See ya around
thanks matey
haha alright, good luck with it
anyway I gotta do some homework haha
They've locked you into the system
You have to give up all that support
Like if you ever decide that you don't like the way microsoft is doing things then where do you turn?
Is that it has all the support
But that's one of my main angers with windows
yeah
On one hand, if all it has is support, then thats not good.
On the other hand, if it has a LOT of support... that *is* a mjor selling point that cant be overlooked, and means that developers have more people/recoces to look to for help
yeah
But really it's not saying much if the only thing windows has going for it is program support
gaming, programing, whatever.
for whatever you need
You have all the bases covered then
I have windows, linux, and mac os all installed on my desktop
I am
I know we were all big on games back in the day. idk if you two still are.
The only thing im 95% certen of at the end of the day, is, Windows seem to be *the* system for gaming due to support. You might argue that support is all its got for it, but that still a hell of a thing to have going for it.
The metal has worn off on the strap
CMD.exe should burn
CMD is so bad
I’ve been using the same bag since 2014
I love my hackintosh's bash shell
Love that
I still have fucking shoes from 2013 I ware
But as operations systems
Not as companies
Unix is so much better than windows it’s not even funny
then again
Not a crack in sight
its still going
absolutely
Same
Unix > windows any day
I've managed to get my iphone 5 to keep work
iphone 6 was the worst phone i've ever had lmao
But I will defend Unix
And my phone is shit
They might say they wont. But whats to stop them? they get money out of it.
Because I hate planned obsolescence
fuck apple's new laptop keyboards
I will not defend Apple
And im sure they could be doing it right now.
it has
Well
At least Apple doesn’t sell your data
I mean they are but what company isn’t
its scum
Which, while true
Lots of nicks points were about how microsoft was.
I see
Nick did
Oh
I never said I was upset about them being evil
The end of our argument fin,  basicly it was said
If your upset with microsoft for being evil, apple is just as bad. Look at whats going on with china; they support it. Microsoft is evil as well with scummy tactics. so hating on the softwhere for who made it is hypocritical.
If your upset with the way it works, it seems to have a major difference with programing (As nick said)which is a pain in the ass, but otherwise is fairly similar, and day-to-day use is fine between the two.
So really, it seems more so matter of prefrence, or what you intend to use it for. If you program a lot, maybe mac. If you game a lot, maybe windows.

Or scientology
yeah exactly
And windows is catholiscim
Yes lmao
Unix is like Protestantism
BSD was also a clone
Linux was linus torvald's clone of it
yeah, unix was once an actual operating system
Platform I mean
And Unix is an actual working os
Except apple actually
Unix-Like
Now everything is just a unix-clone
or 50 years?
But it hasn't really sold anything in like 40 years
well, tbf unix is
Unix is not a company
Linux is not a company
Microsoft knows how to sell it's product
"I apreciate the product, not the producer."
It's like if communism worked and it had an OS
Linux is literally owned by the people
All companies are shit but some know how to sell their product
Except linux
basicly just saying that its a good idea not to have favorutism with companies
I hate the man
I am neutral
not really an arugment any more
I kinda tapped out and put nick in the ring
Yes I have joined
eh
Is this argument still going on
Microsoft's
I’m back
Yes
Like
I need one of their tablets
The surface pro is a sexy piece of hardware
Besides the surface pro
I hate the company and I hate their products
With Microsoft
I don't like Apple but I do like their products
And don't have an iPhone
And I use hackintosh
Yes that's why I didn't buy a new MacBook
They perfected planned obsolescence
I apreciate the product, not the producer.
Apple will cut off your balls Nick and you know it
But with program support
Mac OS is a great operating system. It's basically a really nice Linux distro
They'll suck your cock when it suits them then cut off your balls next
We can say windows is shit without defending apple
even if they dont say so
and coporations are diven by the bottom line
There is one way to look at it: They dont NEED to sell your info... but they could to get some more money
Why r we defending it
Apple is an awful company
but I wouldnt trust any one group
I dont trust windows
But apple doesn't need to sell your data as they're more of a hardware company
I just wouldnt trust Apple
Yeah
Unless you live in China
I feel like anything via corps now adays *will* violate your privocy
Now their whole thing is privacy
Apple has come a long way since that
I know apple had a whole shlik a while back with the NSA
Which you can't disable
It logs everything you do and sends it to advertiser's
I mean
It's also anti-privacy
thats its major flaw
Very much so
its a pain in the ass to program on
So from my understanding
If you play games why make it hard on yourself
But I don't hate people who use windows
But imo it's valid
I do have a hatred for it
Haha
and it always felt like just a deep form of racisem to windows
It's only a thing because they've lobbied for it to be impossible to sell a computer without windows installed
I've always heard you talk about it and get angry
If windows were introduced today as an alternative OS it would be laughed into obscurity
but
Ha its fine nick, i know you two get heated about this
Also I'm sorry I didn't mean to get so worked up
Developers hate windows so much that they went and took the entire Linux kernel into windows to try and make devs not leave them
Look up windows subsystem for Linux
Because windows wants to be different because it makes it harder to switch away
The existence of windows makes my whole career more of a pain than it should be
Basically windows is built on a broken and non-standard platform. Mac OS/Linux/BSD/QNX etc are all based on a tried and true base (unix-like)
Anyway,
If you want to compare the morality of the two, I feel both are supper evil. Apple supports china with the whole thing going on right now. All big corps have some amount of evil, and Id say calling one more then another is just being bias to them; which I feel you two very much are.
If you want to compare the funconality; im not up to date on everything, but what little I do know seems to be windows can do basicly everything os x can do, but not vice versa. Also, currently it seems that any function youd use on a day-to-day life is avalible in windows. Maybe there is some stuff you would want if you are programing thats only in OS X, but im not aware of that. Day to day windwos seems fine.
Windows might make things only work with their own programs; but most corporations do this. Apple does with with their chargers for example.
When you say its a pain in the ass to program on; you mean strait through the DOS? or through a langage?
It is
I wouldnt call the compony that sells you a phone with removed features compared to the phone before, "Not as evil"
And you aren't forced to deal with them
So is apple but much less so
Microsoft is extremely predatory and an evil company
They helped develop it with the promise of making it cross platform then stole it and made it windows only
DirectX started out because Microsoft fucked over this softwAre company
They don't have a consistent design language so half of their programs are for touch screens, half from Windows Vista
Literally has built in keyloggers and ads
It spies on users
Windows purposely does things differently for that reason
It does everything differently from other OS's which makes it harder to port things to other OS's
Not macs fault
But it’s the developers fault that games don’t work on Mac
It's based on DOS rather than Unix so it's a pain in the ass to program on
Windows is usually like 10 years behind when it comes to features
But they only have program support because everyone is forced to use it for other support
But, why is it so shit
Windows only has support going for it
Windows is an absolute shit OS at every level but due to bill Gates being an aggressive and anti-consumer ceo, windows is like the required os for everyone to use
Im saying ive seen you two complain about windows all the time, but see you suffer and be unable to play games
Because endless legends developers are garbage and it doesn’t work on Mac
Windows is cancer
Nick Shon is bullying me saying Mac is trash
Some OS's may have bugs that need fixing but devs just to decide not to bother
Most game engines support all three operating systems
Some lower level libraries are different but the game engine usually handles that
Or is it Macs fault for requiering developers to learn a different system/reprogram the whole game just for it to work?
Not being able to play a game is a developers fault
You’re used to the bullshit
It’s all you’ve used
And its ended up blamed on Windiows, NOT mac
But I see really big problems, like unable to play games
And, I hear you complain (and nick) but... Never have I expeierenced the problems you two say
I can make an actual comparison
I have too
I’ve used windows all my life though
Perhaps because there play base is too low to invest recorces into it.
Not enough customer base to worry about
I feel like, maybe, you are like that with windows.
Game developers just don’t give max OS X two seconds of their time
I feel like its a similar situation that tyler has when he gets into a game he is not expecting much from
If its a game he likes, he remebers all the good stuff. Oh that bad thing? Eh, it happend like 3 times! no big deal!
But if its a game he goes into not thinking he will like it, *anything* that is not perfect will put him on edge, he will remeber it, and wont enjoy fun parts because he is too busy being stuck on the bad parts
Windows has given me aneurysms however
I’ve never had issues related to the OS itself, hardware yes (keyboard)
Shit
Shot
Mac literally never has any issues unless it involves games with developers who are shy
All my life
I’ve used both
It’s certainly gotten worse over the last decade but its far better
I feel like there is a deep seeded racisem to windows that you wont let go of
while saying its better
<@!136253782131474432>
but I have seen both you and nick struggle with mac
Windows is hacked together garbage
I've never had problems with it
While I have heared you say that forever
I mean
Bs
Some stupid .net framework be
Windows is awful and game developers are biased and terrible
how so
Windows being stupid is a problem
you having mac has always caused problems
I feel like for as long as we have tried to play games together
For me
Most of the time
Stuff just straight up doesn’t work
oh noo
Every time I log back in it logs me out again
Endless legends endless loop!
Well...
Now it’s an endless loop!
1 month ago
not expecting it
the dev in the thing you sent said they were blindsided by this
I mean
awe jeses
Boycotting endless legends now
Vpn
Steam
And every app
It logged me out of my computer too
😦
Fix didn’t work
oh no
i can barely read this text
okay this is disgusting
and my retina doesnt even go that high
hum
im using an external display
yeah that doesnt even apply to me
Fingers crossed it works!
Ok
I know im currently dpoing it
the thing you linked had a possible fix
https://www.reddit.com/r/EndlessLegend/comments/d1f9u6/startup_problem_on_mac/ezr5gli/?context=8&depth=9
mines the one where it logs you out
thats a different issue
nope
then you can play once, then restart
looks like you have to restart pc?
bootcamp*
so much hassle
totaly
ittle be fine
im done with bootstrap and wine and emulators and shit
just uh
I do not want to emulate windows
like full on boot into windows
https://www.reddit.com/r/EndlessLegend/comments/d1f9u6/startup_problem_on_mac/
and run the game in that
run a ritual emulator of windows
just uh
and that does suck
lol
Rest In Peace hopes and dreams
It logs me out of my computer when I try to run it lmao
It simply does not work on this version of Mac OSX
awe 😦
There is no fix
Yes other people have the same problem
Id recemend google as a friend. I havent a clue how to work with mac. It be great to play that again
Maybe
i think it might be that the game does not know what to do when there are multiple monitors
rip. Maybe there is a solution somewhere
Had to cmd alt escape
It just goes permanent black screen
😢
Extremely annoying
oh no
crashes me
doesnt work on my computer so far
endless legends of endless


well that made my entire computer crash
Perfect use for it
Oh that's a good idea
ive started installing games onto my external HD
true
It depends on the servers a lot too
disgusting
://
with a tiny blip of 300mb
its been 80mb for this entire download
:/ yeah same but I usually get around 500
im suppossed to have 1gb internet
The MacBooks have really good cards
rip
Most wifi cards go up to around 500Mbps I think
does that mean i have a good wifi card
i got 300mbps briefly on a wireless download
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GkCJmzXyJA
Yea
But you probably don't want to risk it
I did it before with virgin and they cancelled all fees when I cancelled with them within a couple days
fair enough though
damn man
Thats basicly how much tyler and I have to work with for a month, before internet/phone/food is done.
140 is not something we could pay right now
Ah
And I didn't even use it
Like I got our speed with rogers doubled for the same price by switching to bell temporarily but bell charged me $140 for setup and the first month :/
hum
only issue is you may get stuck with fees for the new isp
Then they give you something crazy good
you turn down the first couple deals
With a dope deal
Then rogers will call you begging to come back
They will call rogers to cancel your subscription for you
Then switch to that
Find a better deal
Look into other ISPs
Rogers has a great retention team though
I see. Maybe we should look into a way on getting it lower.
rogers
Who are you with?
ahh
so we dont get hungry
looking to reduce our internet bill
We are with rodgers right now I think
It's normally like $200 a month
Yeah lol
It's a fucking amazing deal
Unlimited?
Who are you with and what do you pay?
That sounds like a good deal.
Hum.
we've had to switch between providers quite a bit to get that deal
but
$60 for 1Gbps
a month
how much do you pay for your internet
hey nick
oooh that'd be tasty
i imagin it would taste like cold sweat
I wonder what it'd taste like
its disgusting
I fucking hate that
https://i.imgur.com/o8cs1d8.jpg

Oh man I can't watch it atm
this is a masterpeice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VamgprCpEGw
this
Nick
because nobody wouyld have to strategicly vote
Yea yea. Its a solotion CPG grey showed. One of em.
Where you rank the parties on who you want most to least
ranked ballot? from like the videos I linked last night?
because 70% of canada doesn't want right wing
If we had ranked ballot the conservatives would never win again
We need ranked ballot
They really did
yeaaaaah
ndp and green got fucked by the system
https://www.fairvote.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Canada-votes-2019-no-branding.png
I thought that was total number of seats %
Ah I see
But in numbers, conservatives had more votes
because of how the ridings are setup, more seats were won by the liberals
thought liberals are
concervitive is winning?
wait
it was really close
or something like that
31% conservative
30% or so liberal I think
% of total votes
as in
the % lib won by
also whats like
oh boy
yes lmao
is this gunna be just like qubec wanting to leave
oh man
lmfao alberta wants to leave Canada because Trudeau won
https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/wexit-trends-after-liberals-win-minority-government-1.4649470
he didnt even vote conservitive XDD
oh

https://www.thebeaverton.com/2019/10/voters-send-clear-message-of-ugh-fine-trudeau-again-i-guess/
Well we made some space I guess
Hahaha really?
Great job on that 0 seconds of walking you just did!

Also <@!136253782131474432> like 20 more people came after you left
Haha
https://i.imgur.com/FARguTc.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/eTEtYQp.jpg
So they don't expect to become the government but rather have more say
More seats in the house of commons
They just have more say when it comes to laws
And how are they doing so good
What's the deal with the BQ party? How can they win if they only allow voting in Quebec
I think it was Elizabeth's own riding
I saw that lmao
That's what CBC was saying too. Literally right after they went from 2 to 1 haha
Fin thinks they're going to get some more in BC
Lmao
thats 1 shot for the drinking game
lol at green with 1 vote
Yes the CBC is projecting liberal gov again
looks like its close between lib and con
Hah
Coast
The west coat
Ohhh
Dude Alberta is 100% conservative
Lmao
"Don’t you want to at least get buzzed?"
"This evening play a game I like to call "drink responsibly:" Take a shot each time the Greens win a seat."
what if the comunist party was majority in BC
Unless alberta makes it like 70% conservative
Yes
the very last place to place their votes
so if its even, it comes down to BC
BC is the wild card
I love how
Around then
Yeah
true
ish?
so that would be... 12:30?
yeah
ah true
when all the polls are done
9:30 in bc?
wouldnt it be at like
wait
So probably around 10:30 ish
ontario polls close at 9:30
When will the votes be finished tallying?
Its very very hard to know if thats ture or not, and get them together
but
now if 10000 people were just like me, all in the same area, and all voted ndp, it would have made a difference
Like it just doesn't matter so why vote
it's true
like my vote for NDP litteraly did nothing
I feel like the current system supports apathy in voting
hey there is another colour
(then a bounch of bonus videos)
the playlist has like 4 videos about voting
CGP grey is very informitive
I like this video you linked
of all of his voting vidoes
Here is a playlist
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNCHVwtpeBY4mybPkHEnRxSOb7FQ2vF9c
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo
hold on
The current system is awful
there's other systems
that's what trudeau was supposed to change!
where a "block" is counted
instead of the current thing
every vote was pooled together and counted
and
what if voting became electronic
what if
especially alberta
alberta & manitoba are heavily conservative
BC is mostly ndp I think
Up until BC
yeaaah
west cost is mostly con right?
lib are winning
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYrY_945co0
no problem matey
for the healp
Yea thanks nick
wait, if conservatives get in i'll actually get super drunk and call in tomorrow
!
yeah1
Oh wow that’s cool that they accepted that!

Gunna work early tomorrow
Also I can't stay super late or get super drunk
I had to vouch for shons address lol
hell yeah
That’s great community support vibes
I'll have to wake brianna up
now i'm eating real quick
And nice
Why aren’t you at election party!
I was taking shon to vote
All 30 something seats in Alberta are conservative
No you can’t call it lol
Nick where are you
yeah nevermind it's only the atlantic canada polls that have finished
although maybe alberta hasn't handed their votes inyet
we can basically call this election already
Right beside the building
I am here
*the circled k*
see ya at cicle k
be there in a minute!
ok see ya soon
You can come over
I'll come get you
Hell yeah
I am good

UGGGG
SAw him at climate rally

I saw him at LCBO just now and I look like a complete bum
time
I run into the director of the masters program i applied to all the tie
Sounds good!
Ok see ya soonish
for sure
Shower shave etc
sounds good!
Ok. I have to shower, give me like 20-30 mins, then I’ll be good
But I'm going to findlays around 8:30 to watch the turnout of the voting so we'd have to go fairly soon
And that's ok
9:30pm
I’m really uninformed
Midnight? 11? A week?
Lol I mean how long till voting is over
Just bring the SIN that's it
like under 5 minutes
So I don’t need anything else? And how long do you have to vote?
So I don’t need the letter. Good
Ok
But your SIN card works
I think they're really lenient
It can be old
Does it have to be recent? Or can the letter be old?
I’d have to look but I might have one.
I might have a letter form Ontario works
yeah it's the easy way
Naw we do it too. Guess it’s just easier.
We etransfer our landlord too but I thought that was just because it was a private landlord and not a big apartment
Yes
There is no paper to show
oh damn really?
We don’t have like s paper bill. We etransfer our landlord monthly.
Haha what about your bills and lease though
I don’t have anything on that second list
What if I told you
yes just any one of those
?
or even any of these
So that’s all I’ll need
Yes

SIn card works
That works!
I think I have an expiered health card
yes!
hm
I have a sin card
no
lmao
Lol I don’t think my key/fob would count
Do you have a health card?
One sec i'll check
https://www.elections.on.ca/content/dam/NGW/sitecontent/2017/resources/policies/Identification%20Guide.pdf
Hum...
Something with my address
I’d
I think something with your address
What counts as if
just an ID
What specific do you need
Ahh yes you do
Do you need Id to vote
Also
No worries!
it's basically right around the corner
I would need to shower
But yea basicly texting or phoning won’t work
but for real want me to drive you to vote
I get 10gb of data though
Haha
I pay $70 a month lol
Mines more though
even for me
For me yea.
oof that's pretty expensive
It’s 50$ a month I don’t have to pay
that's ok, discord is usually easier anyway
oh shit
Yea I don’t have service any more
Oh really?
Do you want to go
Texting me or phoning me won’t work

viva la revolution
You did not
You didnty
yeah

Hahah
I voted for the communist party
Shon must have had another jaws marathon last night
Sent a tezt
17058250413
Oh I may have it
Hi cumming I'm dad
do you want that
i have shons phone number
you want to know youre cumming?
We may go now but <@257986741896609802> we will drive you later
I also want to vote
I want to know I'm coming :|
are you doing it
do it
<@257986741896609802> I will show up at your house and drag you to vote
<@257986741896609802>
I'm exactly the same as shon
Oh

I got mine emailed actually! I'll check my non rushed test
wish i had my screenshot
lol nice
Apparently i'm non-progressive
i was right next to green on mine
oh nvm
he is a communist!
<@!257986741896609802> i'm going to make you vote today
lol
I wish I could vote for a Bloc Ontario
it makes a tiny fraction of a difference
Though it makes absolutely no difference
lol nice
I'm voting ndp on purpose
Haha ok
they dont need to know
im telling them i voted green
im going to lie to them
Nate will be happy
it
(which it is) ill never hear the end of
Hahaha
ndp
after weeks of arguing that green is better than nd
I have to keep that a secret from my roomates
Dont tell anyone though
Don't blame yourself, blame fptp
I think im only going to vote based on values from here on out though
but still not green, which is my heart told me to vote
So I voted NDP, not liberal or green. Only because this riding is 95% chance liberal, 5% NDP. And there is a really good chance of a liberal - NDP coalition to oust a conservative minority, so it lends support to that cause, while supporting a more left wing gov than liberals
:(
Still trying to wake up
i feel guilty about my vote already
I'm gunna vote soon
just voted

pls meme
i predict that the next meme will be about ww2

pls meme
Haha
That's why Reddit was invented
Yeah

Fence
Drunk hooligans just knocked over the Elgin fense
Yep
With a pinch of sadness tucked in somewhere
It’s Like anxiety in a physical form
Yeah for sure
That usually gives me more anxiety
Haha yeah shit I get that a lot
Weirdly accompanied by the need to constantly take really deep breaths every once and a while
Yeaaah
In the chest sorta
Yeah
It's more of a physical sensation eh?
Yeah on one level I know it’s illogical but I feel like I can’t beat it
It's awful
I know that feeling too well
I had a coffee today maybe that’s why
Ahhhhh
An unexplainable sense of impending doom
I think it's mostly coffee
Same sort of
Im being kept awake by nonsensical anxiety over nothing
That’s too long

Yeah basically lmao
"We REALLY want to help everyone but... We dont actualy *want* to do anything to achive that goal"
The way you explained that sounded like
haha
No parties like that exist haha because ones that care about spending money on people in need generally care about social issues
Not spending any money on society to save the government money and lower taxes but also really caring about social issues like LGBT, immigration etc
What would a -10 -10 party look like
I noticed there is a lack of any party in the bottom left. What would that look like?
Also
Whether you choose between green, liberals or NDP after that is more based on specific issues
Yeah, then it's anything but conservative or PPC
I think my general opinion is that; we should help canadas people in need, the poor and the sick, those with disabilities and illnesses, etc, and once we look after our weakest portion of society, then we can go out and help anyone else that needs help/help the world.
Sounds good mate
Anyway, gotta do some dnd stuff now.
Yea. I just feel I haven’t kept up to date.
But it's a good thing to vote
Liberals are 99% guarenteed to win in our area
tbh it doesn't really matter who you vote for in our area though
They're fairly progressive but haven't really done much
Liberals are kind of in the middle and what we have now
NDP wants to do quite a bit about climate change but lesser so, they focus more on social things like helping the average person more through different forms of assistance. Like forgiving tuition debt, cheaper medicine, etc
The green party is super left and want to do the most about climate change
Basically, conservatives and PPC are right wing which means they want to lower taxes and don't really much believe in climate change or social welfare
I don't have opinions on a couple of questions as well and that's ok
this is mine

Hahaha
And all of the “do you find x person trustworthy/good” I just put a 5.
Most of the questions I had no opinion on or was not informed enough to have a good opinion on
But
So left 2 and up 1
I’m aparently -2 +1
It's made by CBC so it's non-biased
And based on your responses it'll recommend parties
This asks you questions
https://votecompass.cbc.ca/canada/
That feels like I’m being manipulated with uninformed information
That's all you need to know!
Just don't vote conservative or people's party
time to read some platforms
I’m not informed enough to make a proper vote.
It's your civic duty, son
want to come vote with us
Uh
Are
are you voting tomorrow
it's all political
I don’t even know where
And I was pinged in them
100+ messages

:(((((((((((
shoo
get outta here
:((((((((((
:((((((()((
I'm sorry
go do your work
Also you should
that would be so cool
ndp - green coaltion would be amazing
It's the only reason the conservatives even have a chance
same
i hate infighting on the left
😦
they were distributed on ndp pamphlets to every household in the toss up ridings on the island
yeah big lies
not that I believe that
And anti-gmo
I've also heard that elizabeth may is anti vaccine
both lies
they said greens were pro life, and would support a conservative gov
Oh wow

What did they say?
vancouver island is very very interesting, but makes me mad at NDP for lying about the greens
Haha jesus

I know lmao
lol so exicting
ahhh

liberal super star
yeah but its ctaherine mckennas riding
There's so many signs though
that's it?
ndp has a 6% chance of winning in my ottawa riding
havent decided
same with green or ndpo
Just to say I did vote ndp
i did that last election
might vote ndp though
yeah
hahah
I'll assist with the liberal swarm
It's alright though
oh rip
My drivers license is actually ottawa now
like drivers license
bring things with picture and renfrew address
you can vote for renfrew in ottawa
you still can!
yeah the margins of error dont even touch
maybe I should have voted in renfrew lmao
yay FPTP
yay your vote doesnt matter at all! 😄
I clicked the wrong one first myself
>99% chance of winning
Median household income:    $67 660 (rank: 186 of 338)
holy fuck
Lmao
wait
ohhh
With Anita Vandenbeld
Ottawa West-Nepean
I think there's two nepeans
i thought you were in nepean
oh what
81%
scroll down to odds of winningh
unfortunately
NDP has 0 chance
yours is pretty safe lib
maybe I should vote ndp
lmao
4% chance of con gov
wow lol
if you just keep scrolling down
woooooo
Median household income:     $101 984
yeah odds of winning is 96% lib
http://338canada.com/districts/35064e.htm
Yes
Probably
Percent popular vote actually
or
of winning
44.8% liberal is my riding
for your riding?
is that chance of winning or percent popular vote?
oh wow thats a total tossup
42.7% vs 32.4%
renfrew's almost guarenteed conservative but the liberals are close
damn all of ottawa is neraly guarenteed liberal
maybe i'll vote ndp then
9% chance of green
13.3% chance of ndp
28% chance of conservative
There's nearly a 50% chance the liberals are going to win in my riding
ok
lmao
I'm probably ghoing to now
Hahahaha
http://338canada.com/districts/24007e.htm
please waste your next 6 hours surfing 338
jane philpott is going to lose her riding
lmao
Bloc majority gov
Waait I take it back
will greens win victoria, or sooke
will jody wilson raybould win as an independant
like will bernier win his riding
but riding specific should be interestingt too
same
I'm betting minority liberal gov
sweet
I'll bring $100 bills
so bring toonies
to watch results? we might bet on some ridings
I should be!
you comign over btw?
lmao ok
thonx beb dont let me talk about polictics until monday
I got some assignments too
And alright man good luck with it
yeah honestly
Fuck the conservatives
😦
okay i gotta do an assignmenbt dfue midnight 😦
but if conservatives get back in, those are the kind of jobs that dont exist anymopre
That's awesome
Tjat
so that he could help with environmental policy
but quit his job as chair on a non-profit as soon as the liberals got in
he was not welcome in the harper days
also my prof who is a fucking legend, who works in inside baseball advising the chief science advisor of canada
yes lol
It usually costs more to take things apart than keep them
I don't get how the conservatives can think that it's financially smart to just come in and rip up any new projects
im pretty sure they would try to disband or repeal it if scheer got in
They are vehemently opposed to bill c-69 which was recently passed that made a new environmental impact assesment agency, that i have been ramping  myself up to work for eventually
and am considering it myself lol
Im not too mad about strategic voting
so
right as i come out of uni
I will have no job prospects
If conservatives get in, I am out of the job
I always welcome more information
:
I don't take offense
and say
I want to be devils advocate
BUT
thats what i always am in political discourse
i know i am being a trigger
BUT
IM procrastinating 😦
that does put it into perspective
ah
that basically sums up my reason to want to vote green

lol the liberals are barely better than the conservatives
this sums it up
https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/confronting-carbon2/
LNG does sound bad though
:^)
They aren't anti-nuclear :^)
They want to forgive tuition debt
yeah same here
albeit, faster than the liberals
my brown sugar salt and pepper daddy
I just like how they want to masively increase our public transit
but they arent acting fast enough on the issue of climate change
And salt and pepper jesus is a great dude
Basically, NDP has amazing social policy, better than the greens even
So I can't agree or disagree with it
I don't know enough to properly discuss it to be honest
and has even voiced being pro fracking in the past, but flip flops on that
but is pro LNG
he is against transmountain, which is oil
cleaner than oil, still bad
LNG is liquid natural gas extraction, and generation
grandparents have since they became a party
Is the LNG the pipeline?
i love ndp, and my family has always voted for them
then id have no qualms
and do shitty disinformation campaigns like the cons do
if only the NDP didnt support LNG 😦
But I don't dislike the green party
I'm just a fan of the NDP
itd be hard to acheive but at least its an aspiration
closed loop energy economy like the netherlands
no more fossil fuel generation
phase out program
no new developments or exloration in fossil fuels
no more imports
halt to all oil and gas aspects of economy lmao
if you really are woke enough to know we are out of time then look at the greens other platforms points
geothermal! 1000, but we dont have much of that here
tidal maybe 150
wind 180 times better
solar 120 times better
hydro 100 times better
We *are* out of time
Id rank it maybe 10 times better
And we're running out of time to do anything
But it's a million times better than burning coal or oil
Yeah, you're right in that it isn't technically sustainable
yeah its obviously better but i write papers on this kinda thing in every second class, on the philosophy of throwing the word sustainable around
point three saying nuclear fuel  is extremely dense
https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/3-reasons-why-nuclear-clean-and-sustainable
im talking millenia here
And when we mine the shit out of everything for uranium and then run out?
It's a fraction of the danger it once was
We've made huge strides since the 80s
And the more we use nuclear, the more funding goes into it
not for true sustainability
It's just the storage of the waste that's an issue
It's a scale
I don't think that's true at all
and you cant be more sustainable, or less sustainable, you either are or your arent, meaning you can keep up the same activities without a burden on future generations, or you cant
hydro isnt even sustainable
sustainable
careful with the word sustaionable my dude
noooo
Nuclear is proven to be sustainable
the deep geologic deposit thing is terrible too, they tried it in the states, was suppsoed to be good for 8000 years, and after only 2-3 years they detected radioactivity in the nearby town lmao
But we're at a point where there won't be a future if we don't switch to something non-emitting right away
we just have these warehouses full of hundreds of barrels of radioactive waste that needs to be monitored for millenia
which is a burden on future generations
like thousands of years of management required
but the plants will still have now make pretty horrendous (close to permanent) waste
obviously thats the 80s though
yeah that's not good
oof
and there was a big scandal when a tractor trailer went off the road into lake superior
I'm against that
yeaaaaah
ahhhhh
they used to send trucks with radioactive waste up north to dump it whereever people werent
my gpa was director of security at atomic energy canada in the 80s
doing studies in thunder bay to find a good spot for it
I feel like the hate on nuclear is a push by oil
Theres profs at my school commissioned to look for deep geologic places to store the waste
I don't like how the green party seems dismissive of them completely
Yeah it's very probably lol
Im pretty sure all of ours right now are terrible lol
Yeah would be good to consider those for canada
Relative to current nuclear power plant technology, the claimed benefits for 4th generation reactors include:

    Nuclear waste that remains radioactive for a few centuries instead of millennia[33]
    100–300 times more energy yield from the same amount of nuclear fuel[34]
    Broader range of fuels, and even unencapsulated raw fuels (non-pebble MSR, LFTR).
    In some reactors, the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the production of electricity, that is, a Closed nuclear fuel cycle. This strengthens the argument to deem nuclear power as renewable energy.
    Improved operating safety features, such as (depending on design) avoidance of pressurized operation, automatic passive (unpowered, uncommanded) reactor shutdown, avoidance of water cooling and the associated risks of loss of water (leaks or boiling) and hydrogen generation/explosion and contamination of coolant water.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor
But the newest generations of them are really good
Old reactors are definitely bad
it just doesnt contribute to climate change as much is all

like theres noone out there who dares call it renewable or sustainable
Its way worse than i thought before i got the chance to study it in class though
I just think there's a lot of misinformation around it
like thorium reactors
Yeah
I still think there should be more effort on R&D though
which is kinda neat
the biggest hydrogeological effort in the country though
theres 200 scientists who make a living off of tracking the plutonium in groundwater flow around the plant lol
plant
I did field course to nuclear power palnt
I dont really disagree
would just phase out and research
oh turns out canadian green party wouldnt even pause it
Ontario is at least
Depends on what provcince youre in
But most of our energy is powered by nuclear right now
Green wants to up funding of research and developpment, but put a pause on generation
But I think it's incredibly stupid to write it off
That's good
The liberals put funding backl
HOWEVER, it can be better, just when we had conservatives in, the didnt fund improvement of it
Billions go into dealing with the long term waste of nuclear, and its not renweable since there is a limited amount of uranium and thorium available, and you shrek the environment mining it too
Sustainability implies renewability, and no waste or burden on future generations
I love it
and yes brianna haha
man youd be so surprised how much money goes into dealing with the waste
A tik tock
he has
in deep geologic deposits
He has a tik tok
And the easiest way to reach 100% sustainable energy
No its really not dude, the permanent radioactive waste that needs to be stored for 50k + years
The newest generation of nuclear plants are extremely safe
that doesnt mean they wouldnt fund ways to make it more sustainable
It is though
Its not sustainable
haha yeah so am I, the way we do it now
https://youtu.be/kOw9UWS8JwU
i am more green than ever
Apparently they're against nuclear energy
saying they are pro life
idk, i've kind of lost support for them
massive ndp disinformation campaign on vancouver island
im so sad
green got shreked lately

I paraphrased badly lol
100%
Yeah
second part yes
nah he def did not say it like that lol
To combat the conservatives
And that jagmeet would work with any other left leaning party
NDP has no chance in your riding so i fully understand
I'm pretty sure jagmeet said just vote for whoever to keep the cons out
I've voted ndp for most my years of being able to vote
so people being phoned now say they will vote liberal
because as the ndp puts it, the settle for less lol
bc people dont vote on values, they vote on strategy
its legit because of strategic voting days before the election
I wanna vote for ndp because I wanna help them but :((
But I haven't heard anythign to cause it
btw, <@!331154975457673228> do you know what happened with the liberals and ndp? NDP support dropped again and liberals went back up
That'd be so nice
65 ndp seats
33 green seats baby
I want jagmeet so bad
you see that 338 thing where it projected what it owuld be like if we did have proportional
between libs and cons
but this riding is a swing riding
if it was proportional
if it didn't matter I would vote ndp
and green/ndp never get in bc he always lives in rural areas
bc he votes on values, not strategy
😦
lmao
bc he has never voted anyone in
my dad has never had his vote count in his life
Nick suggests noe
I've wanted to vote jagmeet all election
horrible strategic obligation
nepean west is only conservative or liberal
UNFORTUNATELY
I gotta vote trudeau
i wanted to make sure she was voting
sorry chooms

......
gparents took me to hospital and by the time igot there it had dropped to 103, probably because it was winter and i was outside a bit on the way there, and they just said "go home, take advil/tylenol" lol
Holy shit
you get brain damage at 107 lol
i remember i had a fever of 105 when i was a smol kid
so annoyingh
Its kept me up the past few nights :(
I think the one i hate the most is nausea
I didnt have any stomach or food stuff with mine, those symptoms suck
Anyways, hope whatever you have doesnt last
Oh wow

Wow 392,000 people got vaccinated for the flu last year
nooo
Other organs
My kidneys
Is it killing me
Is it my liver
Is it the flu or am I literally dying
He says I'm feeling pretty warm
but i mean like relly warm
if it feels like really warm to the touch its an easy way to detect high temp
I also just run warm
get nick to put his hand on your forehead
hahah
No bum thermometer ples
hot flases and cold sweats in alternation
Oh no
thermometer under toungue or in butthole
If u don't have a thingy
Like
How do you tell if u have a high temperature
but those are 'technically' flus, *pushses glasses up*
yeah i had mild fever from last cold
24/hr flu
from colds
There's a fever and nausea you can get
colds =/= flu
influenza = flu
there is no common flu lol
That's influenza rather than the common flu I assume
Oh wow
(confirmed) cases
cases in ottawa

oh weird flu is rarer than i imagined
Also dizzy
No sniffles or anything, just super upset stomm and nausea
Could be a really bad cold
Was at it's worst yesterday
Kinda been getting worse
Oh probably not flu then
Noo been going on for a little bit
Thats awful
Did it come on suddenly?

Can't eat
I'm super dizzy and like
I think the only criteria for flu is bad fever
I actually don't know
Not even fully sure this is definitely the flu?
you running a temperature?
I haven't had the flu in a long time either tho
Hahaha
that was right at the end
when i sneezed into your pillow 😦
Oh noo
lasted a week
Bad cold this year though
I havent had that in years
Oh thats terrible!
And yes
I think I've got the flu
@everyone are you all going to vote tomorrow

You can get bed bug poison
:(
I had nightmares about bed bugs all night
Getting free pizza and beer at work

Tomorrow.
BED BUG
because if you ALL are then maybe its bug bites
has anyone else in the apartment been having bites
could be spider bites maybe?
Not that there are any bugs this time of year anyways
Wasn’t outside though
bed bug bites**
or high volume in multiple areas
just cuz BASED ONLY ON THESE SHITTY GOOGLE IMAGE PHOTOS it looks like bug bites are high in volume in one area
it could just be some regular bug bites
but! youve been home in renfrew too right
if your really really worried
the new mattress is a crazy level but
can you invest in a new mattress and wash your bed sheets in hot hot wtater
Hard to see from the hair
Been there for two days now and it’s finally clicking what they could be from
hm they look like there are a few
sned nuds pls
the volume
So itchy
hmmm to ME these look like reular bug bites but i think its like

Nudes
Kinda yeah on my leg
like this?

Cockroaches and mice and silverfish
My apartment is a ducking nasty ecosystem
really?
The bites look exactly like they do in pictures
I’m so angry
im sure you dont have bed bugs
I bet I ducking have them though
oh!
Went to my grandparents
I can’t event check I’m not at home
on the corner
take a peek under your mattress
really?
Been stressing out so much about it for the past few hours I can’t even sleep
I have bug bites on my leg and I’m fucking terrified that we have bed bugs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trwZnm-5b5Q
it ended happy
yea
It reminded me of a long BB episode
El Camino was good
Yes it is
that sounds a little gross
oh
Apparently my tv has problems playing HDR content so I had to switch to using my PS4 which doesn't support HDR netflix
Let me seeeeeeeee
😦
I restarted the whole tv :(
maybe restart netflox
thats a little too dark
I think
I can't make anything out
I can't see anything

dark
its not that target
its dark at the start but
I watched it last night
uh
Is el Camino supposed to be so low brightness that you can barely see what's going on
will do
Alright, let me know if he does :p
Haha yes if he shows up i'm still down
Well, if fin's phone died and he was on his way to your place, he might still show up. I guess we will figure out from there
Yeah, sorry shon. Just had a really early day today so i'm pretty tired. I'm not sure what's going on with fin
Awe, I was all ready for today. If everyone wanted to do it tomorrow then thats ok. Still no word from fin; did he let his phone die again>
I want to watch the breaking bad' movie tonight haha
Then the beans my commence
Tomorrow would actually be better for me
i will make free time
I am free litteraly any day if it involves ***B E A N S***
Im also free for tomorrow though if we did want to reschedule
*B E A N S*

This is the worst meme I have ever generated

But it’s “mom can we have Jagmeet Singh?” And Jagmeet Singh at home is Trudeau in brownface

In this format:
I’ve been trying to find this one meme
That houses every single meme every created and they have excellent metadata
There needs to be a good meme database
Once you’ve seen it once it’s kinda gone forever unless you saved it
Like it’s impossible to google a meme
There really isn’t a good way to find a meme
Xinny the pooh

In one sitting
I watched all the movies
Of course I know my jaws lore
Tbh I'm really bad with network stuff
Oh haha
Okay its probably something my dad needs to set up in his email
So Sad
but it loads forever then disconnects from the wifi entirely
log in page
then obviously it wants to set itself up
CAn try to connect mannually
and 5GHz
2.4GHz
on the modem
The network is up
AND
Its xplornet
Idk man
Hmm
wifi network
Oh
Sup
why cant i set up this new network at my parents place
<@!136253782131474432>
help me nick
wow shon you really know your jaws lore
I'll watch it someday
But yea the quality just drops. First was a classic though.
Awe geez.
One of the few to get that score.
Holy fuck hahaha

Jaws 4 has a score of 0 on rotten tomato’s
Fun fact
Kind of like Titanic 2
Hahaha
lmao
But 4 *jumped the shark*
So uh. Realism left after 2.
Jaws 4: the shark roars like a lion and has psychic powers that lets it instantly follow you through underwater labrinths
Jaws 3 was about a mother shark avenging the child shark it was caring for; that does not happen in nature.
Jaws 2 was jaws 1: again. Same story. Noting really new, but ya know. Not bad.
Jaws 1 was basicly a rogue shark that had gained a taste for humans. I know some animals (lions) will eat humans once they get a taste. It was a good movie.
Did they just decide like fuck being realistic
Was Jaws 1 serious?
You can also clearly see the mechanical parts of the shark when it’s on screen in some scenes
The shark roars like a lion.
The main character has gained psychic powers to know when the shark will attack.
It made the swim in under 3 days. It hunts them specifically.
The shark follows them, when they traveled via plane, from Florida to the behamas.
But the plot of jaws 4
And the horrible animated jaws coming at you with horrible animated guts
blobs
Really shitty red paint
It's like
And lmao
so much buuild up for this explosion
But yea. That ending.
Except jaws 2; it combusts
lmao
Every shark explodes
oh
It always explodes
why does it explode
Watch that explosion
at universal studios in florida
And the explosion
It just drifts
I've seen the model they used for those scenes IRL
When it swims
The shark does not even move
Like
And it was NOT good at the time either
I know
That animation is so bad
Like
lmfao i'm watching it now
Jaws 4 was particularaly bad. I mean 3 was awful. But the plot of 4 was nonsensical especially.
let alone 4
How can you make more than one movie about a shark
I mean
It just progressively got worse
Yes
Did you see the video I liked
So each jaws lost 3 points on your scale
But yea
Hahaha
I kinda did
Jaws 1: 9/10
Jaws 2: 6/10
Jaws 3: 3/10
Jaws 4: fuk/10
have you slep[t
lmao
Maybe
I
lmao did you watch jaws all night long
Fin you should do a movie review on it.
Jaws: Revenge is awful.
Man.
Oh man. This is gunna be a spicy meatball 🌶
They also have mystical powers to know when the shark will attack their friends.
In under THREE DAYS
Also; the premis: the people flys down to the Bahamas from Florida Becuase they are afraid of the shark, and the FUCKING SHARK FOLLOWS THEM
Anything with revenge or resurgence ends poorly. I can’t wait.
Jaws 4 is next, and I can tell with the title “Jaws: Revenge” I’m in for a treat.
Truly a work of art we can’t recreate.
And look at the 30 seconds after 2:30
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=arsAllZIa1Y
Just look at this. Look at the first 30 second of pure bliss
Jaws 1 was great. Good movie. “Smile you son of a-“ *BOOOM*
Jaws 2 was alright. Not great, not bad. I did like the ending, tricking the shark. “Come on, come get me”
But jaws three. Oh boy. That’s uh. It got worse. Way worse.
Man I watched a jaws marathon
It was for furniture
Strait up adult swim territory
Another add just started with a close up of a man screaming
I feel like that’s more of a drawback then not
I don’t feel that’s actually something you want to advertise
And I
Like the fact it was in Walmart was a selling point
One was “the number one male enhancement available in *Walmart*”
And these late night tv adds are spicy 🌶
Watching tv and stuff
So I’m at my parents right now
Throwback to the best meme to ever grace this earth https://youtu.be/OT4MyqrWo6E

you want to be eco friendly right
wtf
lmao
https://i.imgur.com/KdAXDFr.jpg
Make sure when u delete ur files u sort them for the garbage men
lol
It's mostly because of the 88 being so bad
People who live in Kanata get downtown quicker than I do
yeah for sure
There should be more of a direct route
I know :/
weird that they dont really care about people from nepean getting downtown properly
But the bus is never crowded
So if you miss it it ends up taking longer
wow nice
It runs every 15 minutes
It's a really short route. That's basically the entire route
is the 50 new
Yes
never heard of the 50
is that the train and then the 50
wow nice
<@331154975457673228> nothing beats this route

This homeless dude is yelling at another homeless saying that he took his spot
working man here
im at work
yes
Workin man
You at work
How’s it going
I wish I had it
Unfortunately not
I need the Jagmeet Singh at home meme
Nick do you have a meme on hand for me
Lol
I'd never buy a cod game normally haha
Fucking activision
So shitty
Lol it's like an 80$ game
It seems really finicky
I don't really know what to suggest
Weird those should just work
2 xbox ones
Yeah for some reason it's still not working. It sees both controllers in the settings
What controller are you using?
It mostly just kind of started working though
You can't add a second player in the lobby itself for some reason
You have to have both join right at the first lobby screen
idk past that
it looked like he had to connect the controler before he started the game
I saw nick having a lot of problems getting it to work
I can't get it set up. Player 2 controller doesnt register for player 2
Hey <@136253782131474432> how do you get 2 controllers to work with wwII zombies?
Kk awesome
Sure thing. Ill be over soon
Not today. So you could start walking over if you wanted
or walk past mine?
Will you show up at your place
Nice
I'm around 6 minutes
How close are you two?
Seeya
Kk
seeya at your place
going dark now
is dying rather
my phone died
lol nice
You'll probably get here by the time the 88 shows up
I'm finally at Billings bridge
Also was that a response to my text lmao
So do I
i hate reliance on the 88
I'm dying
wow now we literally have to take the 88
Good
Haha
Are my dice there
Sounds good. And yes it's there
Look in your car
Oh nick!
Let me know when you want me over and I’ll head over
It is? Great!
D&D is on

How are you feeling <@331154975457673228>
So I'm rich on megabits and apologies yes
But I didn't get anything except an apology
Yes it's back and I'm getting like 700Mbps now
Nick r u rich now
Is it back
Lol
no but i'm assuming it was because they got confused
Did you figure out why it got cancelled?
And I should!
I didn't! they did
You should get a rebate
You accidentally hit the self destruct button?
didn't want to deal with a call for something that should just be reenabling my account
Nice
i'm in a chat with them
You call them?
idfk
Why
What
what the actual fuck?
What the fuck they fucking cancelled our account??
For fuck sakes, our internet has been down for almost 24 hours
There's nothing to snipe!
pls snipe
They're the ones that should be taxed more
Yeah definitely not
no excuse for giving oil and gas industry a break though lo
probably the provinces fault
Maybe thats not the feds fault though
because they werent doing it in the meantime
yeah the federal gov won in the supreme court, saying that the provinces cant opt out. However had he cooperated more, 2 years wouldnt have been wasted
Tbf I don't think Trudeau can force provinces to not opt can they?
Its like a cardboard cut-out version of socialism lmao
Provinces opt out, all the oil and gas companies dont have to adhere to it, its only hurting small businesses, and its fuckign miniscule anyways lmao
yay you did it
Carbon tax
Another example:
Way better
Yeah the individual states who legalized have done it better
no benefits, with all the bad sides
no startups, no tax revenue, no innovation, no advertising
you cant even apply for applications to study it yet, unless youre a billion dollar company
it may as well still be illegal
so theres still a black market, and noones profiting off of it
but its barely taxed, and regulated to shit
yeah congrats you did it
Example: Legalising weed
Beyond the strategic vote to get rid of conservatives, i really don't see a good policy-driven argument for voting liberal. Its basically just like upholding the status quo
yeah that ones true too
it upsets me
he posted this which is kind of funny
Yeahhhh
But facebook is so full of propaganda that you just fall into this web of conservative propaganda
Without facebook I think he has sane beliefs
It's fucking weird
Same
And yeah i agree with that last one lmao
He spends a lot of time on facebook
He falls into the false news trap very easily apparently

and then





every post on my dad's page is related to trudeau
I know lmao
thats such a 8chan comment
Hah
Conservative: Backwards. 
Liberal: Lets go in no direction! 
NDP: Socially progressive, environmentally not bad. Green: Socially not bad, environmentally great
And he believes some bombshell is about to drop about trudeau
He's a really smart person, I don't understand it at all
It's so confusing
Hahaha
A truly rare focus group
for real
Politics on acid
Thats like
it makes no sense
Oh wow
Even though my dad's a green party supporter
Thats terrible
And thinks scheer would be better than trudeau
He's aggressively anti trudeau
NOoooooo
He's turning into a boomer
my dad is buying into so much conservative propaganda on facebook
Oh! Is it?
Monday is a holiday right?
It has like cum on it lol
Love that anime hoodie video
NIce probably same
I'm going home for one of the two days
Nick you going home for thanks giving weekend?
That’s great
HHah

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBQ6_0IROfw
Rogers is still down for us gdi
I hate that white tower
Yeah...
Maybe they should improve their fucking routers
Yeah it would probably be a lot faster with Ethernet
Tbh my wifi adapter only goes up to 840Mbps
Maybe in Ethernet?
From 500 to 1000
There’s no difference
Same!!!
Bell is awful though, haven't cancelled their connection and their 1Gbps only gets up 32Mbps
Then they'll give you 1Gbps for $60 after tax
And tell them bell offered you 1Gbps for $65
Them they'll call you relentlessly
Get bell to cancel for you
Switch to bell
I was offered 1Gbps but I've noticed no speed difference
I’ve been with them for 4 years and they are charging me way too much
I'm mad too
I’m mad at Rogers
It has now yeah
Damn, has yours come back up?
Mine was acting up yeah!
Ours has been out since last night
Is your Rogers out fin?
Even though we have a climate emergency
There hasn't been any major green changes besides the carbon tax
Yeah that's true
but thats exactly what populism is, is trying to appeal to the masses easily, without nessecarily acting in their benefit
which is dangerously partisan as a member of the upper gov
We even got a lecture about policy operationalisation by a Deputy Minister in my poicy class and he was agreeing with that lol
I don't know much about that
Haha yeah fair enough
dont get me wrong, I like the things they 'talk' about, they just rarely act on it lol
buys pipleines the very next day
Declares climate emergency
A liberal minority would be the best choice
big talk, no action
makes it a policy, find a loophole in their own policy to avoid it
same with their duty to consult indigenous people attempt
but dont do anythign to operationalise what they do
its like they are posing as being left
heard
then not listen to them, or set up communications policies to ensure everyones voice is hear
Liberal will make a promise, like cabinet diversity with racilisaed and women members
HAh
Can we just all vote for the BQ

Economically they're center
nope
Socially they're left
centre right*
right left
Center left at least
the populist choice of the left
They are centrist, status-quo enforcers
they arent good enough
something majorly wrong
them
I know theres something wrong with the
Honestly I don't think there's anything wrong with the liberals. I think people in Canada just get more quickly of a party
hah
Nice
thats not a bad number
69% lol
https://trudeaumetre.polimeter.org/
But yeah not implementing fptp was a blow against them
Have kept more*
Something like 85% of promises were kept
Liberals have made more promises than any government in like 40 years
Id also love to see Indian Jesus lead our country
Another broken liberal promise
It’s far off without proportional rep
I'd love to see a green government
Decoupled from carbon
Work with what we got until the economy is switched over
Green would stop all new developments and imports
But NDP doesn’t step it down enough
I say we just get rid of Alberta
Liberal is way worse, they have that and energy corridor, pipelines, and all
Same reason Trudeau supported the pipeline
Because he wants Alberta’s votes
Also he hasn’t asserted lack of support for liquid natural gas and fracking
The federal gov had more power hwre
Because constitutionally you can
We aren't the USA
Which I don't agree with
Yeah that kinda sucks
He said he doesn't want to interfere with provincial policies
He debates that last night
Secularism bill
Also Jagmeet hasn’t said he would interfere with law 21 yet 😦
Angela
Andrea
That's it!
Merkel
And lmao
https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/vb5yj3/quebec-man-tells-jagmeet-singh-to-cut-off-his-turban-to-look-like-a-canadian
I also watched a video last night where he spent a day with Doug Ford lol
And yes I loved that video
I was talking about her last night
Fuck what is it
Or
Margerett I think her name is
I want her to be as aggressive as the Chancellor of Germany
Should see the video where he was asked to cut off his turban
Jagmeet is amazing too
Ah, fair enough
Policies and actions do
Debates mean nothing
Lol may has had a higher impact on bills and amendments than any other MP in Canada’s history
Jaghmeet is really soft spoken but I feel like he's got really good values
Idek about jaghmeet although I really like him
She had a hard time getting her voice heard in the debates
I'm also not sure Elizabeth may is a strong enough leader
Yeah
That’s for sure
Liberals aren’t the best, but they are better than conservatives
So I'm voting liberal
I think nepean is a flip flop between cons and liberals
Haha
And also strategic voting
My vote doesn’t matter anywhere since this is a safe liberal riding and renfrew is basically safe conservative so I’m just Gunna vote green
I think Trudeau is a strong leader
I'm happy with our current government
But I do like nearly all of what the liberals have done
Yeah, personally I would like to vote NDP
I guess strategic voting is a thing
That’s more socialist than the NDP even
No idea why you guys vote liberal then lol
That ones Brianna's
Same
Almost exact to be honest
Mines similar
Hey dude

Brianna just did hers and it's basically identical to mine
I could find it but it's really far back in the chat logs
<@!331154975457673228> do you have a copy of your poltical spectrum
Fuck that sucks dude
im just starting to feel it now
it hit annie earlier
I have no clue
How'd you catch that?
I'm glad we didn't do d&D then haha
Fuck man
A flu and a midterm
Fuuuuck
so thats great
Annie and I also have the flu now

Sad nostilgia
Ah
I'm just like I remember this but not very well
Like looking at something you used to know a ton about through a fishtank
Cuz I don't really do it anymore and I'm like all out of it now
why so
Being in art stores brings me a very profound sadness now
its a great combo
I'm going to start calling it the latey-eight from now on
beatuiful commet
"It's not called the "Latey-Eight" for nothing."
its the single worst buss
Everyone agrees

Brianna has an alien fetish
https://youtu.be/Hwczxp7h7Gg
Paul is my all time favorite movie
yes they are. In their own uniqe little way. Sorta.
The Greys are so cute
👽 👽
Quicksilver learned how to bend the weave to use magic. Basicly saw what others were doing and just coppied it .Party learned after he gaiend the ability to continuosly heal himself.
Not technically very accurate but
I love the Greys
....
Ive done that any time I have anything alien. Cuz, well, it does not seem to make a lot of sence to have aliens just be "little grey men"
Wonder what they think about magic
Yeah that’s pretty cool way of doing it
spooder roach
to get the point across that it, whatever it is, is just not earthly, did not evolve here, and follows different rules.

Oops

The point of the story is whenever I have tried to have something alien, I try to make it really REALLY not conform to anything veaugly humanoid.
But yea it was an entierly silver creature that, by the time they fought to kill it, took on a form with 6 legs, a oval-esk primary body, 4 "arms" (whatever tool it needed) and no head.
Basicly it was a loop. The party found that, when they fought it, they had to do the revearse of what they normal do. Normaly in dnd you use your big powerful stuff first, to try and kill the enemy quickly. Instead they used their weaker stuff first, because if they did something and it DID NOT kill Quicksilver, he would start doing that but better.
Haha nice
which lead it to belive it had encounted a VERY violent cell type

and it only learned more as more people deffended themselves/attacked it.
so it came to the conclusion that, to defend itself, it must destroy the hyper agressive cells it has seen (basicly it saw some of the cells in humans as a paracite/virus that was trying to kill it)
Well this thing, basicly its first encounter with humans was being attacked (it was the party lol)
Ah I see
But once attacked, they can reorganize the goo into blade arms or whatever
To infiltrate them
And they learned to organize themselves to even mimic human form
Becasically they are a grey metal goo
That doesn’t show it well
Learn from fighting
Creatures
Goo creates
It’s the same thing
https://youtu.be/tsdi4025xqs
Never watched SG, so I dont know what they did :p
So at first it just kinda stood around. After somone poked it, it learned how to harden a portion of it and jab back. After somone swung at it, and it took damage, it learned how to make a blade and return the blow back.
Like the replicators from SG1
Yea no cell was specilized, each was the same; they could all comunicate to do stuff. It also was a quick learner (where it got the name Quicksilver) and once it saw how a group of "lesser" cells did something, it learned how it could use its own cells to do that, but a bit better.
Kinda that transition between unicellular and multicellular
Corals are technically animals
That live in the same structure and rely on one another
Technically unique living things still
No specialization either
Kinda like early coral cells
Interesting
Yea. Just each of its own cells were percicly the same. Again, a grey goo kinda creature.
That’s how multi cellular organism evolved
You could argue that are nothing more than a hive mind of cells as well
It used the term living. Because it couldnt concive that, cells that are not directly linked via hive mind, could work together to make somthing greater. Basicly, it had no cocept of something being greater then the sum of its parts.
Like an amoeba
and yea, sentience is probobly a better way to see it
And have purposes
I mean cells are living too
So it thought it was the only true living creature, and everything else was just cells without pourpose.
it never made that conection, due to the way they move. Its own cells were conected, moving as one unit; while cells in other creatures seem to move without a greater a deep conection to eachother, just bumping into eachother or doing their own uniqe buisness.
The only sentient organism I guess you meant
Haha it must have known that groups of cells moving together similar to its was conspicuous
Everything else was just cells that could be eated or left alone or converted.
Not these guys, but a different alien-esk creatures I made for the past campagin:
Quicksilver. Seemingly a murcury-looking creatures, it was basicly a hivemind of a bunch of single cell orginisims that it could quickly shape. Think grey-goo like creature. It couldnt "see" things in the traditional sence. It would see a tree as a bunch of plant cells, and a human as a mass of cells as well. it could only tell creatures were moving around it by looking at what cells moved quickly, and what did not. So it had no concept of live, of other creatures; it only saw itself as the only living organisam in the universe.
For reading books
Do they have microscope vision
Indeed. These creatures make these fractals out of their own mass, seemingly being semi-liquid entities.
Can get very small
Ahhh neat
A part they will find out, is the way these things 'talk' to eachother, is forming fractals off of already fromed spirals, making the overall structure larger.
Interesting. So you do have it worked out then
Anything? I dont think it could convay everything.
And I know a really big part of how these things comune is not revealed via what is sent, and is a cool concept.
Anything can be conveyed using it
Universally?
Is the language universally applicable?
Yea. Perhaps somone could understand the core ideas, but still. There is a large part of the language that cant be understood with what is just shown; and I think it is a "Ohhhh!" moment.
Do it does have a solution then?
Can still get the rules but not the meaning
I mean, it might be possible to, but I dont think there is enough.
Solve no, understand maybe
I do know there is more to it, and what is show is (as I belive) not enough to "solve" it
Are You still thinking about how to make it lol
Mayhaps
Or is it still in development lol
Do you have a solution for it yet Shon
Interesting
So there must be larger concepts with smaller ideas nested within that rely on the larger concepts
But they are nested
The branches can be read from most outward to most inward
Since the spiral counter clockwise
I think the spirals do have order too
exactt 😎
gud memes
he likes good memes
friend from class told me has Aspergers in the first day or 2 of us talking told me about being a mild alcoholic at one point AAAAND i like him
I know the least
i dont know if ive told any of u about aiden
(thats aiden btw
with*
I just wanted to share the spirals fin fin :p
Haha thats alright
just wanted to show u mi pictures
anyway sorry
video
like the c
thats neat haha
just makes it a bit bright

i wish it wasnt so over-exposed but i dont think its hurting the image too terribly
yeah i used mi feets
i guess bc youre not using a dolly
he called it foot zoom haha
yeah!!!!!
look at how different the backgrounds are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5JBlwlnJX0
like
its really really cool isnt
yeah!
you did a dolly zoom
like you back up rather than like
yeah wow
OH
oh the dolly zoom?
the first one is well focused
like keeping the subject in the same kind of distance but zooming with your feet
focussing?
stuff
lens
uuuh
it was like
my camera was dying only wanted to get the shot i needed for class haha
so i wasnt too concerned with that
yeah over exposed but that wasnt the name of the game
"over exposed" might be the word
thingy
backlit a bit too heavily
same one different uhhhh
but backlit
Looks well focused

it was playing with lens ssstuff
looks veyr well made. Could see it on offical websight
And yes looks nice
Ah, interesting theory.
nice pic brianna
could be a symbol
"greetings" "peace" "friendly"
this is Ash from my class btw haha
random and unrelated but look at this picture i got today sorry for interrupting
Alright.
and all need to be read at the same time to understand whats up
i think each branch is a word
So would that mean (with your idea) one full branch is a statment, and another branch is an entierly different statment, or a similar (but different) statment, or would all of them need to be read to understand the statment.
ABA
probably a word
3 pieces of information within that branch
thats one branch for example
Spiral symbol, low fractal break, medium fractal break, low fractal break
They all start with: Spiral symbol
Sure
Ok. So one "branch" is a statment
or maybe a word at least
within a single symbol
no each path from large to small is
You feel that each spiral is a different sentence?
I think the high - low order matters
I think a single symbol has multiple 'sentences' of sorts, depending on which direction it is read in
Fractals, which are something found everywhere in the universe. It might make sense why an alien could use it to comunicate, as it is seen across the universe.
combinations of the same three locations
but not always in all of them, or any of them
and always breaks in the same three locations
it -is- fractal
Perhaps so. They are in a dangorus location and dont want to leave this thing.
They'll have to find something to help them 8O
they dont know how to translate it,.
but
that is how it seems to be comunicating
I actually used to draw stuff like that on my note books haha
anyway
Well, its sketches I made
That's pretty
Those are the spirals the entity my players found made with its arm

Oh man that's very complicated
Ok om

Ooooh
its their writen text
the image fin sent is from a movie
and they figure the spirals are its language
That circle thing is a language
it drew spirals
a group of players found an alien like thing
a fictional langauge
a phrase from a language
What is that picture
Oh is that... A language
The thing I posted
We are talking about alien language
its from arrival
Oooh what's that Finn

part of the insperation
I enjoyed it
Yes I have seen that
yes
That the one with the aliens they tried to decode language?
reminds me of "Arrival"
I will point out, when its "drawn" (it formed off of the entities arm) each spiral is drawn at the same time. Your binary reads them one at a time.
colons seperate levels
being read largest to smallest and counter clockwise
where a 1 represents the presence of a fractal break, and 0 the absence
the binary i made above is for the first two symboles
Thats pretty cool
More or less.
Did you invent it?
Regardless this is more or less my way of depecting an alien language.
I think maybe the layering is significant on some level, but each pattern shows a general idea
as in it has many pathways
I think its pattern oriented and is not linear
1:111:001100:001
He belives, thus far, it is not a cypher, and that it cant be read like traditonal langague. His current theory is each spiral is an individual word, with the language being very basic, and there are only so many concepts to it.
Whats been driving tyler up the walls is that every language follows the pateren of being read left to right, top to bottom. That, and almost all secret languages are gust cyphers of another language. This appears, as far as he can tell, to NOT follow either of those two rules.
1:110:101001:001001
right, that gives it order
but the fractal breaks always fall on one of those three
The way its made: The middle spiral is drawn first, then every spiral touching it is drawn after, then every spiral touching those is drawn, etc.

I dont think there is enough info here atm to solve it.
But
Mayhaps.
does it actually have rules
The first is the first thing it said. The second section is the second. The 3rd was a "reply" and he said one after the other. The final one is **important** for some reason
did you invent this

That is the language.

Well

<@331154975457673228> what do you think
I still have another plant to harvest tomorrow
This is from one of two plants

the internet mans birthday
Gonna treat to a snack
<@!296572507241054209>  I invited her because his birthday was yesterday
Oh no what thing?
i had thingy due midniht 😦
Oh right
Internet man?
Ooh nice
<@!136253782131474432>  might go to denny wit <@!294754564261806081> after internet man
8O

nice dude!

It dries better if you keep some
Apparently I shouldn't get rid of all the small leaves rn
If*
Of that
I'm only 1/4 done one plant

Done
But looks like either way you’re getting er some
You might want to consider using a drying rack so you can just cut the buds out and it’d go so much faster
Yours is so much stemmier than mine
Nice nick!
How’s it going
Thanks <@331154975457673228> !!
<@331154975457673228>

Oh man this is going to take so long

Maybe watch some YouTube videos on it
I would read up on that

thats exactly it
yes!
Sounds like the f value to me
because they write it as fractions
i dont understand how to explain it how they explain it
thing is
when you say change from a fast shutter speed to a slow one you gotta mess with your other settings to compensate
thing is tho
yeah!!
Speeds of like hours and hours can let so much more light in, allowing you to see stars and stuff! But if you don’t move the camera with the stars momevemt , they will appear like streaks
Super fast speed is like and instant moment
Shutter speed just dictates how long the camera is open to incoming light!
Like what the aperature is and stuff
if u have a shutter speed of this how do you compensate everything else
its the like
I know the bare minimum!
cuz im not understanding how theyre explaining it :c
like re-explain things to me
2 weeks
in like
<@!331154975457673228> do u know enough about cameras that you could possssssibly help me study for a test i have?
Curing is then responsible for 50% of bud quality

Haha yeah that’ll happen
My hands are getting sticky haha
But you cure after a week
Depends on your humidity too
I’m surprised
It actually only takes 5-7 days to hang dry
And lol
Yeah!
Or whether your plant put all its energy into leaves lol
Gunna look cool without the leaves! Gotta see how big your buds got
Sounds good!
But I’d aim for smaller
I’m sure you can get away with it
Can’t see the buds
Maybe not actually
Hmmm
Yeah definitely
Too many for one hang?
That’s a bunch of branches
Nice

Can even get rid of the leaves coming right from the bud
Then repeat for next branch
Ok
Basically just clip a branch, get rid of the leaves, then hang the branch
Should I cut away all the leaves before anything
The good ones
But you can cherry pick the buds you want to hang
Bc if there’s any mould there it’ll spread
Ah ok
We chopped for top down, didn’t hang the whole plant bc we read it’s less successful
Hanging + trimming
And yes I did
Ok so should I chop from the bottom
Bring dehumidifier?
Just hanging for now
Ok cool
You don’t cure for like a month though so don’t worry
If they are too wet they will mould in the fads so it’s a balance I guess

We avoid that, but that’s interesting
Yeah
For curing?
The link you originally sent suggested some kind of moisture pack
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565663569132257283/628058005186936842/image1.jpg
Uh don’t use moisture packets
Scroll back to the way I hanged them
Discord won’t let me send photo
Also should I trim all the leaves?
Or take the branches off
Like the whole plant and work from there
So should I chop from the very bottom
Ok
Leave a tiny bit of secondary branch on for easy hanging
Harvest time baby
This smells amazing

Just cuz I always come in really nasty and sweaty
I hate walking to school
That's true she is
Rude!
She left it on the carpet 😠
Haha she does a lot
Kenya lost a NAIL!! 😯😯😯



Any experience with moisture packets <@331154975457673228>
And a humidity meter
Gunna pick up some clothes pins and string
Got my big huge dehumidifier
Ok omw home
Spool
And yeah you’ll want like a big spoil lol of something to hang it on
Dehumidifier sometimes has the humidity right on it
String
Humidity meter
So what all should I pick up
Cold but at least it isn’t raining
Noice
After class
Yup
Up
You harvesting today?
Good idea
And bring your dehumidifier
Maybe string them up in your moms basement
And throw out buds with too much of it
Be sure to look for mould
Ahh
He can't help easily from new Brunswick haha
Axel can’t help?
Time to rescue your bud
Haha
Looks like I have a busy day tomorrow

https://www.leafly.com/news/growing/drying-curing-cannabis
And trim the leaves away
Bud stems
You gotta cut the buds off
And you can’t hang like the whole plant since it’ll mould
But I think for a while
I’m not actually too sure
How long do they dry for?
Just trim the shit out of them. gotta hang them to dry, then put them in mason jars to season them
I can't keep it at my apartment and my mum won't know how to take care of them
We have a dehumidifier
Tbh I don't know how I'll do this at all
Any higher and hey will go moldy
Idk how I can do that
That's fine it's only two plants
You need to keep them inside at 50-62% humidity
Ok good
But you’ll get wet
You can do it tomorrow
Because it’ll rain tomorrow
The guy from the hydroponics thing in renfrww was saying he harvested all his today
Oh fucking hell
Ours are getting moldy already
Shit do you think they're fucked
But after all this rain in fall
I said we waited until October because we covered it last year
Go to my house rn and harvest for me pls
Fin
If you have a greenhouse...
I'll go home tomorrow
I thought you said to wait until late october
Moldy
Oh fuck
Because they will get moly’s
Yes definitely surprised you haven’t
Should I harvest mine now
Holy crap

This is like 1/5

I imagin you doing that randomly from time to time
Just ording pizza to each of our houses and saying we will pay with cash only
lol
I hope you have cash cus I said you'd pay cash
I sent gabriels
Ok
I uh
i eat once per week and it is at dnd
nick pls order me pizza rn
All the perks of being a coupon lady without being a coupon lady
I use it on Amazon
Oh! I've never used it for that
It aparently also works with like, pizza and stuff. So thats nifty
Also it's not as good on Canadian sites as American ones that ship to Canada
Doesn't usually work on items that are already discounted
Got American psycho cheaper
I use it all the time!
Definitely
Yea, it could save a lot. Or nothing. Worth a try :p
I should get it
oh yes I think Brianna uses that
Oi <@!136253782131474432> have you heard of Honey? its an extention that searches for coupons automaticly and applys them. Might be useful for all the pizza you guys get haha
Provided I don't chicken out
Anyway night Finn thank you for talking to me , seeing Sean Monday so hopefully all will go well
Nice!
So little silver lining
Eh is what it is I got to see my parents out of it
Np sorry again you had to deal with that
We're trying
Yeye goodnight thank u for the advice
But keep on keeping on
Anyways I gotta sleep
That’d be huge
Ayyy nice
Plus I signed up for co-op
Better than nothing
Nice! Hopefully a better culture
Or trying to
I think I'm basically literally just switching to loblaws rn
That’s like staying with a bad husband because he is the only one you’ve ever had haha
Hhh
Not for long 🙂
Because its like the only place I ever worked :(
You’re strong in character and principles and choose to not surround yourself with people who don’t make you happy (like Dan as one example). It baffles me that you haven’t yet done the same with work!
You’re above petty power struggles at Walmart
Great!
😀
He liked a picture i took one time
If he likes you that’s all that matters
I don't have his email don't think
That’s okay!
Okay I can do that , ive handed in a few assignments but they're all very easy
Second half is more of you send it in email format
Second half optional
Felt * you could attest
I would greatly appreciate it if you get you could attest to my character or work ethic!
Hey Sean! So I’m applying to some jobs right now to try to escape Walmart, and I was wondering if you would be comfortable with being a reference for me?
i always talk to him haha
Then you just go up and say:
It helps if you’ve submitted at least one assignment though! Or talked to him once after class about something school related to show you’re engaged! Then he knows you’re a hard worker
how do you ask
well ill try
oh shit okay
He just sent it in!
After knowing my prof for 10 days I got him to write me a reference letter
Nope!
hi please help me escape my eternal hell
wouldnt it be weird to be like, 5th week of school
i only have sean once a week
ill try but like
Move on up!
But you can stay only as long as it takes to find something better
Forever and ever and ever
Nope Walmart wants to keep you forever
On a no good toxic extension of the worst years of your life
do you really think im going to walk in there tomorrow and just get fired?
i know.
Wasting precious time and stress
I really think it won’t work and will make you more upset
least i tried
That’s futile
like i want to at least talk to trevor with everyone first
Good luck
i want titi to stop before i leave tho
i hope so
HHHHHH
So it’s settled. Walmart sucks. You have a way out. It’s possible. You’re great. You aren’t ruined. You’d be much happier in a work place you respect. You have the happiest years of your life ahead of you
while bawling
walked out
i made them laugh after i like
Then don’t use a walmartian
Being likeable is important too though I won’t lie
my work eithic is shit poor
Which is what matters
Because when it comes to it they likely won’t attest to your work ethic or skills
Nope
That honestly comes off as more impressive than getting a reference from a walmartian
good
is that like
cuz i fortnite dance alot
i mean i know the managers at walmart think im funny?
Well either way he would be an awesome reference! Haha
like basically he's my age
young guy
I’ve used profs before
his name is sean and i think he flirts with me but he might just be very nice
A perfect reference
That’s great!
Those years will soon be past
omg i have one i think
Be sure to talk to your profs after class
and has been my worst years of life
Choose a nice prof
thing is walmart has unfortunately seen me through my worst years of life
You can just use a prof as a character reference. Easy solution
nnnnooooo
im terrible
Renfrew ones are a no go?
but see
nolan has told me before (one today) he likes me a lot and im always really pleasant
i mean the managers at this store like me
walmart has ruined me
this is uhhh what i mean
see
uuuuuuuuuh
violently
because im burning bridges
How about renfrew managers?
That’s true, it’s good to be on good terms with whatever work place you leave
and i dont think anyone at walmart would be a good reference
i just dont have any references
You’ve been institutionalized into thinking Walmart is the only option, exactly what they want you to think, but it’s not!:)
so i dont think she realizes how much you get bothered
thing is... titi is mean so no one asks her for help
You can bring joy to people in many ways, and in way less toxic environments. I hope you take that to heart
theyre fun
oh and the babies that hug you and ask if ice cream will melt in their car
🎅
You’re Santa
that they thought they couldnt have
happy you found something for them
Wholesome
the ONE good part about work is when someone is like
i went and dug in the back for them for vanilla ice cream
Just fruit and healthy stuff
i get this british couple that comes in sometimes
love old ladies
And nice old ladies
It’s basically a grocery store for people who eat avocados on toast
like eb games or hot topic or whatever
ive considered game stores and stuff
Beautiful people living in that area and and great workers there
groups of people who dont know english and you gotta work through everything with them is stressful but its nice when you can help them
Cedars co on bank
Yeah! Some small town groceries are like that
if i could just chill with the nice customers id be happy
And feel pride in your work
You’ll see that things are different when you respect your workplace
because its like
i lie so much now
but like
ive only worked at walmart i guess
Many good many bad
I’ve had 6 different jobs now
i seriously feel that walmart has like.. hurt my soul
With every job I’ve had
My quality of work and of life correlated perfectly with how much I respect and enjoy my work place
i just dont feel like a 'good worker' anymore
😦
It’s not universal I can assure you
That’s all symptoms of walmartia
^
i hate "the man" and i think corporate greed runs everything and i dont give a fuck about working hard and proving myself to them because i hate them and im just a cog in the machine to them
Trust me if you have a job you respect and feel like it’s worth going to, your quality of work improves haha
No one likes assholes you’re not jaded
but like im so horrible of a worker now
You wouldn’t even need to lie
Then that’s perfect!
nice people any way
No such thing
i actually like helping people hahaha
permanently sullied
“The thrill of helping people!” Easy lie
plus im worried ive been like
*immediately kicked out
fuck you
like what do you like about retail
They all have rehearsable answers
im all jaded and shitty now
its just certain questions i worry about
i know its easy enough but like
An interview is being personable for 15 mins
its all i can do really
Then get out of retail
nnnnice?
im not really like
im different than i was when i was a kid
Interviews ain’t shit
Money comes from places that aren’t Walmart fortunately
i dont know how to do it
my mantra is fuck i need money shit i havent done an interview since i was 16
It’s my mantra
Well all I can say is don’t go back, and think about how to reduce shittyness from your life !
cant argue with an entire department saying this shit is a problem
a co-worker is going to help me get a couple of us together to complain together
luckily tho
all i learned is walmart is shit
it wasnt and i probably will unfortunately
Anyways, sorry that happened, hope you don’t go back and hope it was a learning experience with how to deal with shitty people and shitty situations
shit like that takes time to deal with especially if your being pleasant and trying to find them what they want
unless im in the backroom people are CONSTANTLY asking where is this do you have this this that and another thing like
like for real
an hour
and theres enough of them that a 20 minute job takes an hour
constantly
who need you to help them
a ton
you have customers
in retail doesnt matter how long you have
If you have unlimited time for tasks that’s also a diff story but that’s not often the case
if you say CLEAN EVERYTHING and get all this filled and make sure this is full and this is full and its completely zoned at the end of the night i say ill do my best
like if you ask me to get the windows clean yes absolutely
Promises can be important sometimes, when you know what you can do, and the full extent of a task. But when anything is uncertain, it’s dumb and imposing to make “orders”
i will do my best to get everything done but if by the end of the night im too exhausted to lift ALL the milk crates into the racks ill stop at half way
i dont want to promise something and then it not happen
like im not going to promise anything ever
i always say stuff like that
yes hopefully
I’d tell him that I was “hopefully” going to get something done by a certain date, and he would respond with “hopefully?”
well ive been here 5 years and im damn well done with putting up with getting spoken to like this
City of Ottawa manager was kinda bad like that too
I only lasted 3 weeks
im not going to roll on my stomach and say yes master
but im not a fucking slave
Reminds me of McDonald’s
she wants yes
Not cool
she tells me no
no
a direct quote
Unfortunate her bad management led to that
and this is like
after telling her over and over ill do my best and her saying no nope nope
so then yeah at that point i said i didnt care
Yeah
Her expectations did not align with yours of what you could do
at that point i was basically saying titi i dont need to be at me this is not a stressor i need to focus on right now
like over 10 times said theyll try?
like how is it okay for you to keep at someone when theyve said theyll try?
i basically have to tell her okay enough
Nothing wrong with saying that!
she wont stop
so at that point what am i supposed to do?
nope nope nope
Yeah
what i am able
and i said i will do what i can
There is nothing more than your best
nope your going to do it all
but she kept poking and poking every time i said ill do my best it was nope
It should
Yeah you can only ever do your best!
me saying ill do my best should end the discussion then and there
and she said no you WILL do it
because i said ill do my best
it was me saying titi i dont need to talk about this right now if we're going to trevor
I know I would have been fired at some of my jobs for that
which it was not
Nope it’s not, but it can get you fired depending on how you say it, especially as a response to a call for improvement
and i dont think me saying school is more important right now is at ALL a shock
Yep it is I agree
that. is the issue
She was disrespectful though yeah
you cant SPEAK disrespectfully
It’ll get you fired most places if you say that
you cannot disrespect me
i dont give a fuck. i tell them what i tell them im not disrespectful about it
But just if you ever have a good manager some day, don’t tell them you don’t prioritize your job ever
how is that good, how is that a good manager
your job is to manage yes but dont make your workers quit
flat.
thats not how you speak to someone if your a manager
i dont care what it was
im not trying to see her reasoning
That’s not even a question
I agree with you she was unprofessional though
ive tried with her
no.
and she needs a talking to about how to talk to people
Yeah I totally agree! But I just want you to ponder a little bit about perspective, just for the sake of learning.
and she needs to learn how to properly manage people
what she did was unprofessional
i was disrespected
no
i was disrespected
It’s clear she is a dick
look im not looking to argue about this fin
Im@not defending her by any means at all
not how she said it
not really
Like it’s a question though
is telling me to quit
well why dont you just quit
I don’t think she told you to quit, Moreno asked why you don’t quit if you don’t see your job as a priority in your life right now
her job is NOT to punish me
not tell me when to quit
Even if she isn’t your boss she is above you ok chain of command
no. her job is to run the department
my superior is celeste
She can tell you what to do so she is
shes not a superior
thing is
I’ve never told a superior to “stop” or asked something to be discussed later though personally, so I’m not sure about the context
my manager is Celeste
she is the department manager
she is NOT my manager
she has no right to tell me to quit then when i say no ask me why
Bullying is terrible
like no. she is not right in this situation
no. he
she was harassing me and i told her to stop we'll discuss it later but she doesnt let you
i didnt do shit all wrong
this was not an issue with me
ok but like
...
I’m just saying, we know Walmart is very shitty, and so are a lot of the people in it. But it’s sometimes important to self reflect, and try to find small tidbits or areas into their perspectives (shitty as they may be), to try to find out why they do or say what they do, even if it sometimes means conceding some responsibility, that helps you learn to avoid similar situations in the future
thats bullying
thats not management
she is disrespectful and likes to domineer over you because she can
and constantly says how long have you worked here seriously
that we dont do our jobs right
how is telling me and everyone else that we're terrible helpful
how is saying quit helpful in any way
that is what IM communicating
and she does that job poorly
Yeah but I guess if it’s her job to look after the department it’s her job to try to communicate whatever it may be to you
and i just wanted her to stop
like repeats herself over and over
wont leave you alone
like by wont leave you alone i mean like
Right, I guess in the workplace those are sometimes luxuries we don’t have, but you’re not wrong. It’s a bit difficult
i said we can discuss it with trevor later
AS IN the conversation we were having RIGHT THEN
that was affectively me telling her to leave me alone we'll talk about this later because i dont need this stress right now because in the GRAND SCHEME of my life its not my most important stress to focus on
but she wont leave you alone
telling me once is fine
because i wanted her to stop GRILLING ME
and i said we will deal with this matter with trevor
walmart is not my main concern its school
i said RIGHT NOW
i said i dont need this stress right now
Depends on how it’s delievered though
If you said you don’t care about your workplace, her asking you why you don’t quit isn’t that disrespectful of a question imo
?????
she HITS people, jokingly but like
she RELENTLESSLY bullies another lad in our department named james and i hate it
than**
which she absolutely has on many occasions to more people that just me
but hes acting like she hasnt done anything wrong
what do you want me to do is absolutely fine
The “what do you want me to do” question is fair, but the second comment is not
i just want to come in and work and not be spoken to so rudely
as if im doing this because i hate titi and want to see her removed or fired
i cant fire anyone tomorrow
he said to me what do you want me to do
bawling at how i got treated
And mental health is invaluable
i left crying today
It takes a toll mentally
It’s not worth the barely above min wage or whatever it is
And not really ones you should be wasting your tome and energy with tbh
There’s lots of problems
its the manager
honestly the altercation with titi isnt even the problem
I think you need to see what a normal work experience is like
Well honestly fuck walmart as a whole, but on a second note fuck the toxic environment you’d be in now
she cant write me up
she cant fire me
brianna your failing at your job and im telling you to quit isnt really in her job description
make sure you clean the door glass
brianna zone the creamers tonight
like tell me brianna go fill the milk
yes
I mean she’s allowed to tell you what to do
not me
she manages the department
not really no
But is technically your boss
shes basically me with a clipboard
like a department manager she manages the department
shes someone i work with
TITI is NOT my manager
NO
but i mean they were talking about call ins
But that’s not what they were talking about this time?
better late than never
i show up late all the time XD
obviously
I used to show up so late to my job lol
because like
thats my manager and they have talked to me and i said i would absolutely improve
but shes not the one who tells me that
oh fuck lol my attendance is shit
But I can think of some other things like attendance or being late or whatever that I’ve been told to improve personally at one of my jobs (things were I wasn’t doing my best at evidently)
its all i can do???? i cant like magically make myself a strong man
and so i say ill do my best because like
everything i need to improve is revolving lifting
its all lifting
Lifting crates or whatever sure, you can only do what you can do
thats not saying no to improvement thats saying im going to do my best but im not going to hurt myself
i said im going to do my best
not no
i said ill do my best to everything
Well depends on what she said to improve but yeah
because like she's telling me to quit because.. what? im not willing to hurt myself for walmart??
and like the tone is the issue
That is at least respectful
ish
Despite being shitty in other ways
well
Ah well that’s nice of them
i hope you feel better
they said let us know what you want to do tomorrow
Because even if you did it’s a toxic environment if you go back
i mean i do haha
I said EXACTLY that
My honest opinion is that I don’t think you have a job anymore
and i say no im doing my best i do what i can im not going to hurt myself
but she doesnt want that she basically wants a yes master
i always say im doing my best im doing my best
i never ever did that
but the thing was I NEVER refused to improve
If she wasn’t specific then that is poopy
if anything ive had issues the last few weeks from 15 hour days and getting LOCKED out of the cooler
filling eggs and stuff more????? but like i do that i've BEEN keeping up
like idk???/
What kind of improvement?
she treats me like trash and your fine with it
and im like are you fucking serious
if your refusing to improve shes within her right to tell her you may as well quit
and he was literally like is it?
and i went to the managers and im like this was so disrespectful
like what the fuck do you mean why??
and shes like why
and i was like I would LOVE to quit but i cant
Right
which is like you should just quit then
and she said well you may as well put in your two weeks now then
and she wouldnt stop and basically i said i didnt care about walmart right now i have school
and then i she kept giving me shit and im like ok titi lets just discuss this with trevor i dont need this stress right now i have other things that are more important than walmart to be stressed about
Ahh did she do it
trevor being store manager
my department manager titi was telling me if i dont start improving she was going to go to trevor and i said do it
Wait so what started this
sob sob sob sob i need to leave
i need to think
and theyre like r u sure and im like nooo
sob sob i might quit
so it was more like
That sucks though
They might have assumed you straight up quit
because uhhh i was crying
well i said i might have to go home
Ohhhhhh that’s essentially quitting
and i walked out
i walked out. i told walmart i might quit
Diarrangus
really bad
no..
Homework?
it was bad and it sucked
today
i did
oh fuck ummm guess what
he knows what he's doing
With his New Zealand accent
look at that smirk
And then this guy telling shrek it’s old money

because needing to pay shrek 500k not to kill you is absolutely hilarious
your like dreaming state is like a shitpost generator
This is how some of my dreams go
I’m being fully honest
straight up shitposts
these dreams are actually just like
finn like
I remember I jumped into a magic waterfall and was teleported to another dimension, where I was a Jamaican woman and my father was a guy named shrek who was trying to kill me, and I found this room with a bunch of other versions of myself and jermain clement, with slight variations and a few other random people, sitting around on couches in an  semi-open jungle like area. And I had to harvest these portal gun portals on the ceiling to craft a way to get back. But then shrek found me and I had to pay him $500k to let me go, but I apparently tricked him and one of the jermaine clements told him that that was “old money” and was only worth a few dollars total, and he screamed in anger as i teleported myself back to the right dimension
I had the most ducked dream the other night
Also
😃
Thank you for that
this is beautiful
P L E A S E
FINN
i worked really hard
please

In the back seat somewhere

Yes definitely. I could always just join late
Ah yea. If it turns out its not a good day for you nick, we could possibly postpone or something. But I know others are looking forward to a session, myself included. Your call as its your house
About D&D, I'm good sort of. I have to Uber to Kanata after work to pick up my car :/
https://i.imgur.com/AZwNtg8.jpg
We good for dnd tomorrow yea?
I like energy and stuff
mostly the science about atoms and molecules and stuff
all i'm learning in this "science of everyday life" class is that I really don't have much interest in science
these are beautiful
Hahahaha

The second one is my favourite
lmao
lol

Alright, thanks for the imput. This is ~~not~~ super duper important
Yeah I would say the plastic bags too. I feel like "the bag" refers to a plastic bag since you have no relation to it but "my bag" would mean backpack
Understandible.
But bag does not mean backpack to me
I mean u could also use context and assume that when someone said bag they might be referring to their backpacks
I thought the saem thing. I do wish to hear others opinions
It is but it isn't
Because to me a backpack is not a bag
Yeah the grocery bags
Ok. Lets say somone has like, 2 grocery bags and a backpack, and somone else says "Make sure you put heavy stuff in the bag" would you assume they ment the backpack, or one of the two grocery bags?
But there's also messenger bags
Satchel I'd more likely call a bag than a backpack
Nothing else
With straps
A single sack
Bag is like
No
instead of backpack/satchel
Would you call it a bag by default?
1 is satchel
Backpack or satchel depending on the number of straps
this is important and i want to hear everyones view.
A thing you would put over your back to hold stuff in; it has 1 or more zippers on it for storage space, and has 1-2 straps you would put over your shoulders so this thing rests easily on your back...
What would **you** call it?
Hey quick question everyone
Me interrupting to flex

hahah ncie
supper hard/lucky
it was like
I got it haha
and not 😦
yeah theres only two
Have you got the ice ship?
I think they have only 2? mayube 3
i have two lannius ships
cant remeber
and maybe 4 person teleporter
Mantis has cloning bay
yeah
czu it has stuff from the expansion they released
not mantis yet though
the 3rd layout is always interesting
for most
yeah fo rmost
its gr8
nice
also do you have the 3rd layout for any ship?
yeah i got the BASILISK
Did you get any new ship layouts?
rip
the sent a boarding drone into wep room
well maybe next time
Damn
bc they had taken out my weps by the time shields were down anywasys
i should have got rid of drones
i teleported in and got rid of shields
😦
they shot down my hacking device with defense drone
I think hacking device can take over drones
rip drones
2 many drones
i could not handle the drones
i died on the boss on round 2
got taht
yep hehe
have good doors and people just cant invade you
OR they make great deffence. Somone warps in to kill them? room is already missing Oxygen
true
So they are like an all-or-nothing invasion force
Problem I have with lannius boys is that 1 is not enough; you need at least 2, perferably 3 to drain oxegen fast enough for it to matter. And if it DOES matter, your non-lannius boys start suffocating.
to get through his sheilds
and enough weapon energy to fire all ya guns
ye
for big battle
you prob want T4 shields
Maybe put money into shields and energy
Eh
may be good for fighting
he sucks oxygen up
should i get lannius boy
that might be enough with back up
Nice
lol
i can actually damage a four shield ship
so if all hit
this fires 5 lasers
oh that sounds sweet
just got burst laser mark 3
hard as balls
base game is great too
But yea some of the mods are great. One is called Captins Eddition, and it basicly doubles the content, along with an endless mode, and other cool stuff
and they breach
swole af
yeaaah
they are SWOLE
but if your sector 6 it might be too late
if you had drones, you could get a boarding drone
Just thought
yea they are no fun
teleporter
i hate only have 2 person teleported
ah yeah
4 person teleporter, 1 clone bay, engi is pilot/repair man, rest just fuck shit up
Fave build is 1 engi + ~4 or so mantis
Yea
unless you get backup dna storage
but if they disable it ur fekked
yeah good with mantis
the lannius
ohh yeah i do have that
so you cant heal. Only die to come back
cloning bay makes it so when you die you come back. But it repleaces med bay
also a 3rd outfit for all ships
it includes stuff like my fave upgrade: cloning bay
You should have the "dcl" because it was a free update
Also
that may be phase 3 tho
so be warry
I think during phase 2 it will also send robots to board you
they will be dead
that would suk
rip
ah yeah
just make sure to get your people out before it warps away
like their weapons
You can still warp in to blow stuff up
one human
leave one guy in one gun i guess
you need guns
cant handle that
and yea
yeah
the auto-piolet comes online
cmoputersss
then
Like it will do ok phase 1
Wellll
its not looking great right now
how do you think ill hol up against final boss with teleported build though
Also
Yea haha
and mind control the reinforcements
with no renforments
yepppp its perfect
and kill the guy inside
lock it
too late for drones
somone is in
you can hack a room
i agree
Cuz like
yeah
maybe hacking is best
possibily get hacking I think?
If you can fit one more
a non-android ship
Oh nice
i have never blown up a human ship
yeah its a teleport + mind control build
just blow up their ship

or
onto them
do you beam down
So like
right now i have a mantis build
Hum
i have the money
should I go for drone control, hacking, or cloacking
Sector 6
okay so
ill have to check dat out
no oxegen
Oh wow cool
it was metal people
A new race
like
I also think there was free DLC?
I have managed to get all the stuff
Haha I see
i have most layouts
and no i havent! IM still trying to unlock the last few vanilla ships
very high robbability
robby index high all around
have you tried mods with FTL?
hahahah
also
With our combined shity internet, we make ETERNITY
it told me 36 years
the loading bar to connect
It would never connect
it was going at 1 byte per second shon
it did not work
HOURS to connect
it was horrible
and it would take
i remember that
with our combined shitty internet
yess
I think a time we tried to play factoroi together
That reminds me of like
s
good time
yes
back when i had wine
i remember the days when shon and i used to play stuff like sup com 2
how did assigbment go mate
Good plan
I will aim for late at night
Good good.
11
10? 11?
Use Google maps
And what time does worl mort shut down?
Ok
I think at like 2
Late late at night
like stop running
When does it shut down?
After 8 is probably best
Yea that sounds like rushhour
Hum alright. Well hopefully its not as busy at night
Avoid 4-6 though
It's honestly usually busy though
Maybe 6-8 too
Yeah :(
Ah shit missed that time
Well maybe around 1-3
Hmm never really tbh
Oi I dont take the bus often, but for the 88, what would be the best time to take it and get to worlmort while having the fewest people on board?
Thats fine, not your fault.
Yeah sorry I can't get you there myself. I also hope it survives for a while now
Ah alright. Ill have to take the bus to worlmort. Hopefully when you get your car back it wont have any prboelsm for a long, long time. Wouldnt want to have to sink more into it
It'll done tomorrow
So wait, is your car being repaired today, or will it take a while? no idea if breaks take like a few days or a few hours
Yeah no kidding
Thats nice of her. Deffenetly hard to pay for if you were not expecting it.
My mum's going to help me with the cost
:/
It's from the Honda dealership so it's definitely overpriced
Damn.
It's around $550 for both back and front
I think they're doing everything
$1100 seems crazy fucked
If its just the pads and rotors that are bad I could fix them for you for free. You'd just need to buy the parts
Brakes are completely fucked front and back
What's going on with it?
No it's not
thats not fun at all
Oh no
oh boy
My car needs $1100 in repairs
Wait wait a minute
https://i.imgur.com/ejFEqjl.jpg
Sure, thanks m8
No problem dude I'll let you know if I can in a few hours
Ah alright. Yea if its not a hassle; just I need to pick up several things and it would be a hassle to take the buss (and I dont have physical change for it)
if i'm back with the car before then
I gotta drive Brianna around 5 anyway
Might be able to drive you later
I'm getting the car fixed today haha
oh yes
Hey nick, is it possible to get a ride to wolmort and back when you are free? if you got plans or something today thats fine, just checking

False alarm but we gotta wait for the firemen to look
So the fire alarm is going off here
Z war
I think ebberon is one of my favoruit
Forggoten relms is a nifty setting
80s
Just from like the 90s nostalgia
I started reading R.A. Salvatore's Forgetten REalms Icewind Dale trilogy
ST helped introduce it to even more
but yea
I know the release of 5e had a huge impact
True
It was already picking up before that
I think ST made D&D more mainstream again too
Yeah the mind flayer was cool
While the demogorgon had no relationship in DnD, besides name, mind flayer was friggin sick
But yea it was cool as what it was
Demidogs
demodogs
Lmao
dogs*
Demogogs
Yea
They were more like rabid dogs in St
But I really liked it
Haha really stranger things was more of an alternate universe D&D
Here is a mind flayers elder brain, and a mind flayer cult leader
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/1/12/Volobrain.png/revision/latest?cb=20190202091721
(Demogorgon would also be no ones bitch)
Demogorgon in DnD is WAY stronger, but the monster they had was interesting
you have to group up to take it down
Muno-un-muno I feel most people cant fight a mind flayer
But it had a simmilar, although different, power level.
I really liked it too
Yeah it was more of a being rather than an octopus man
https://oldschoolroleplaying.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mind-flayer-eleven-673x1024.jpg
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/2/2b/Mind_flayer_-_5E.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190424130458
they make it... different, but probboly simmilar to how powerful an actual Mindflay is
I really like their version of Mind Flayers in ST
But
Yea the Demogorgon is a god
fighting it
Draxx
There is ya boy
That's a bit more intense than what it was in st

Also do you know what the real Demogorgon looks like?

<@!331154975457673228> is it ok if I bring Kevin to the apartment party
Lol
I swear home depot was a more professional environment
oh my god the political arguments here
i guess they are only half as far as the liberals but still farther than i thought
How is the green so far right
Also is bloc quebecois really that left leaning
Like what they say and what they do are drastically different
Like look at Doug ford
They like saving money for the rich
But they don't believe in saving money really

Bloc is like anti immigration so idk how this is right
i thought green and liberal would be more left
this surprised me a bit
holy shit lol

anything to do with civil rights lol
like abortion, gay rights
also against social things yeah
just horrible short0sighted ones
which are still values
they believe in economic growth and saving money and 'freedom to capitalise'
Socially they're right
Yeah
Oil companies
Cons have values, jsut bad ones
idk man
thats more PPC tbh
lol
"We'll take anybodys money"
traditionalist
yeah
corrupt and right
They're just the corrupt party
I wouldn't even really see Cons are right
libertarian in a bad way
PPC is right and downwards if you know wht i mean
then PPC...
so far right
but Con is so right lol
pretty centrist
Basically they're just center
Liberal isn't really too liberal
Yeah that's my order as well
My rankings: Green > NDP > Liberal > Con > PPC lol
I lve NDP too
lol
I love how the NDP isn't even an option this time
by herself in office for 8 years
they usually do
Shes been leader of the green party for 13 years
Greens also have the best platform
Oh damn
Shes made more ammendments to bills than any other MP in Canada of all time
Yeah
Elizabeth May deserves it
I haven't heard too much from her
And people like him
id love elizabeth may though honestly
And he handles Trump perfectly
oh man yeah
or scheer
so much better than harper
yeah lol
Ignoring this...
lol yeah
Also tbh I do like Trudeau as the face of Canada
But unfortunately not everyone is going to do that all at once
bc liberals numbers would be low as fuck without the strategic vote ll
about how if every actually votes for their values, then you dont need to vote strategically likel
vs value-based voting
right, had huge argument with roomate abotu strategic voting
the last thing I want is scheer in power
potentially trippling their seats this eleciton lol
I really like the greens and would vote for them if it wasn't FPTP
im riding the green wave this time though
i did last time
nice
I'm still voting libs
hard
i'd argue that
lol
I'm assuming nobody was for the cons
yeah hah ture
vote green bby
Who was arguing against that anyway?
fucking hell though
yeah, it was just insensitive
didnt realise how demeaning it was
But he's not a racist
I don't know why he did it
yeah hah
By any means
It wasn't ok in 2001
It was fucking retarded ofhim
yeah
exactly
I get jumping from liberals to greens or NDP but going towards conservatives makes no sense
it hasnt been reflected in his actions in office
BUT
it was insenstive as fuck though
yeah
Yeah
Trudeau apologized right away too
its a campaign promise
and bernier wants to kick muslims out of the country
and he won't apologize
and yeaaaaah
based on those policies
for example in comparison, Bernier is clearly racist
Also christ, look at scheer. He said as recently as 2017 that gays were animals
gotta look at recent (past 20 years) actions and policy
yeah
His entire thing is social justice
I mean come on, everything he's done in office says more for him being not racist than him wearing blackface
"youre gunna scare the student away"
Lol
You hear the middle eastern guy who was at the party with him defended trudeau saying he wasnt racist?
And quit complaining at the fucking office
Something about cultural appropriation
Loads of swearing
Just
I can barely hear the argument
Right
It's in another room
I don't know who's who
Ah
Black dude
😄
Yes
But I do agree with one guy
is anyone there not white?
lmao no
you should chime in
gave me argument nightmares
it was rough
at my apartment
i had that too
they're yelling and swearing
yeahhhh
in my office
system still takes up 96GB
There's a really huge argument going on about trudeau
oh fuck
security update lol
enough to update almost
7GB free now
Sah good
Hahaha jesus christ
thonx beb
jesus lol
i somehow had like 5GB cached
wow that worked
good idea
maybe try removing the cache from chrome
compoopers
would that help
and reinstalled
i think chrome needs to be uninstalled or somethin
got stuck on chrome again though
If it works without then good
Ok
its doing it anyways
It may be necessary
Actually
uuuuuh
i hit cancel every time
it prompted like 20 times
'a new helper tool'
don't give it
What tool
wtf really?
i didnt give it
to install a new tool
oh no ccleaner wants my password
yeah
new reddit is so slow
I don't use new reddit
I still use it
lmao
idk but i downloaded it in like 2012
wait is there a new one?
ah yes
the old reddit RES
could be
Maybe a plugin you have is written terribly and is just nonstop printing stuff to a log file somewhere
Also it's probably a ton of logs more than anything
true
Lmao pages that you haven't loaded in 10 years don't need to be cached
but my pages wont load as fast
But you can do that from chrome
Yes
is that something i even want to get rid of?
how is there that much
but analysed 5GB of google chrome cache before it did
wtf
it crashed
oh fuck
90gb chrome cache
Haha shit
on google chrome cache
it got stuck
oh no
ill delete after
ok
wary?
weary?
It's one i'm more wary of recommending now
ok
It's still ok but I don't recommend leaving it on your computer
do i dare use it?
It WAS an amazing program but got bought out recently
"Slow mac? download cleaner"
it's not too far off these days
like one of those things you avoid downloading
cc cleaner sounds like a scam
:I
no space lol
Download CCleaner
and how do i clean that shit up
onto my current iphone? lmao
You're probably full of log files
hahahaha you should restore it
i apaprently have a backup of my iphone from 2016
yeah that's not right man
why does the OS take up 97GB
Haha
yes
Civ probably
Does it count steam games
what's taking up that much space?
damn man what apps?
makes sense
of apps
26GB
i guess applications hasnt loaded

Wait wat
also im only using 16GB on my macbook and im out of space
you cant back up if youre out of space
what
I also love how a meme became reality
I wonder how much they've ramped up the security for this

Congratulations Sam!!! I went into Walmart to buy some cigarettes. Sam told me about the dangers of nicotine use and the long term effects it can have on your body. In under 3 minutes she convinced me to quit smoking for good and my life is so much better. So friendly and speedy!! Keep up the good work
Congratulations Sam !!! I went into Walmart last night and someone punched me in the face and broke my glasses and Sam literally took my lenses and made a hand carved frame out of firewood and quickly put it all together within minutes
She really is a miracle

KenyA

Haha

picture of down syndrome dog
Teddy honking dog breed
Lol
teddy
yes
.......
Down syndrome dog?
imagine her with the power of garfield
Hah
she bullied that dog so fucking relentlessly
i remember her with my dog
She would hate odi too
Straight for the jugular
Eviscerate
kenya would just try to kill nermal
no
garfield was just annoyed at nermal
she would kill nermal
She has a catitude
Yes haha
less chill about life more like
also slightly more angry
The ambassador of slightly slimmer female Garfield essence
the spirit of an instagram thot
She could be like a spirit animal probably
cant believe you didnt believe me before
Okay I was dubious before, but now I believe you
and he said "she is not obese she is perfect, an ethereal being "
Glad the vet started her career the day before
yes
That’s intense
thats what he said.
"kenya is probably the  best cat ive ever seen in my entire career"
the vet said, and i quote
NO
Exactly
like its almost not there
you can hardely even notice the morbid obesity
Of morbid obesity
Tiniest smidge
Just a pinch of obesity
deception!!
all lies!
A little bit obese
shes in the best shape out of all of us
no!!!!!!
She is a tad roumd
shes fluffy.
SHE IS NOT ROTUND
Goblin is agile and fast
But she’s rotund and slow
She’s rouged up nick a bit true
shes not!
She’s all talk
>8O
8O
Kenya doesn’t even know how to kick
Goblin easy

im sorry for interupting but i have a question
I think it can be done
But I have better rockets now
The reason I didn’t send a person in the first place was because the human pod is way heavier than a probe
But it could be possible
I’ve never managed to get to moon with two stages left
That a tiny bit of thrust is enough to push it around
Because the craft needs to be small enough
I get your point but logistically doesn’t work because you need the final stage to land always
(with decouplers throught)
Rocket
Fule
Fule
AI Pod
Rocket
Fule
Human Pod
Parashoot
I mean like
They can’t really take big falls though
and just drop it when you get to the mun
you could have the AI pod under boosters
Also
Given the tech, could even pump out the remaining fuel from the old lander
Not a bad idea
That wouldn’t even be too hard
Ohhh yeah
could you send a pod with 1 slot, and an AI control pod as well, to control it on the way in, then have the person poilot it on the way out?
you lost somone on the mun
lets say
Theoreticly
nice
But I just got like 300 science for going to minmus
I haven’t even unlocked a pod with more than one kerbin slot yet
But yeah that will have to come next
Also I leave the ships there to act as relays too
EVA give lots of science
I see
And not doing EVAs
I’ve just been transmitting the data for partial value
Rescue
#bring them home
Ah yeah
send a ship with another free spot
Lol
if you sent a person
Was going to say
Got to the moon, and the really far small moon (minmus)
Still, not enough fuel to return them
Well
Not manned
Ah
Nope just sent probes
but cant bring him home?
you got a guy on the mun right
Fin
This really be what I’m doing with my life

looks like the eyes and mouth move
Just your average value village item
what is that
thats cursed
Congrats fin

I don’t have enough fuel for the journey home
Took me a week

I cant screenshot because shift key throttles the engines up
I landed on the moon
Hell yeah
And I am homeward bound
And I got my work done
We fixed it
Well on my way home now
😠😡😠😡
It's not exactly a knockoff but it's not the original
He was like it's ok tho but I've read sometimes they're not very good
And I was like what!!
Ahhh shit
And he looked at was like.... U have a knock off
My camera just turned off suddenly and I told my teacher And he looked and said that I had an error and we couldn't fix it, and I said to maybe take the battery in and out
Yeaaaah it's third party
:(
I have a knock off battery
Also
I did it!
until the image is sharp
so spinning the lense
sometimes those are paired
usually
it means focussing manually
also
exactly what nick said
XoX!!
it means you're dead
Or how long the camera takes to take the picture kind of
exposure is how much light can get in
means more adjusting and configuration before taking a photo
<@!331154975457673228> what does this mean for me
You have to get real fancy
no more automatic
Oh no!
we have to shoot everything in manuel exposure now ;-;!!!
what
guess what :(((

I was not having a very good day

you ned like $8000 worth of equipment or to rent a studio for $100/hour
Yeah he has all the things for it
ah jesus i was wondering how they afforded to produce an entire LP
It was all recorded with his equipment
yikes
Ah wow

Overall, a major theme that I took for this work term was that decision-making is only as good as the knowledge and information that supports it.

I think this is 90% the same as my last two reports lol
It could get caught in a plagiarism checker
Throughout the summer term of 2019, I completed my fourth and final co-op work term for the Infrastructure Planning Unit at the City of Ottawa. This work term provided me with valuable skills, knowledge, and perspective on the field of environmental sciences in practise. This term had a focus on data management in geoscience, but the knowledge and skills gained extended to those transferable to my field and the workplace as a whole. This included but was not limited to knowledge of hydrogeological systems, environmental reporting, and geospatial analysis and modelling. This paper provides an overview of the experience, through linking my projects and tasks to skills and to my academic studies. It outlines the goals and objectives of the organisation, to give context to my involvement, and link the placement with my field of study. This report could be useful to understand the relevance of the placement, the magnitude of skills and knowledge gained, and the exposure to the field in practise, for myself and for future students.
hmm
and replace certain words
do you think theyll care that i basically copy and paste sections from my old report
Yeah exactly!
also
to see directly the payoff of what youre coding

a 3500 report that you have to write on a saturday night though....
lol
😄
Meanwhile the actual programming project is something i'm excited to start
And i've hated every second of it
I'm at 796 words for this report so far and it's taken me four days
1000 word report can be done in a night
noooooo holy shit
I would rather write a 1000+ line programming assignment than a 1000 word report
nope
Haha
they are easier than impossible programming projects
unfortunately
they are so essential though
hahah
Gunna KMS
I hate reports
it's not
nice
With a ton of citations
The full report is going to be huge
that's perfect
then it autogenerates in-text citations and your bibliography
this will come in handy full the full report
You add all your references through a chrome extension and manually on the right
Oh wow

for stuff with over 10 references i recoomend downloading Zotero

ah
oh this is like a weird oen
But the way my professor worded the assignment was weird
I have
have you not had reports with referecing before?
But the prof lists each section and what's supposed to be in it
Yeah, that's what I thought
ok
yeah wel you do the intext citation then have a bibliography/referenes section at the bottom of the report
It's the citation style we always have to use in my classes
usually you have both intext citations and a references section at the bottom
http://www.citethisforme.com/ca/citation-generator/ieee
wtf is IEEE style
Fin if i'm supposed to reference websites in IEEE style in each section, should the references be in the section or all at the bottom of the report

Same reason with VR
You get sick when your vision says something and your ear is like “no”
Thing
And your body is like wtf is going on, when your vision and inner ear say different throngs
Your fluids solidify
Nope just the adult body becomes shit with stuff like rides and inner ear
are you sensitive to that kind of thing 😮
I felt so pukey
It hit me when I took them off

I once tried on a friends glasses at work
they made me SO sick
Hahaha
I haven't been able to go on rides since lmao
It was like “what”

I stopped rides when i hit puberty
You fucked your inner ear up
the spins were real
I hadn't even tried drinking yet
they thought I was hammered
Oh man
People offered to call an ambulance
Oh no
And couldn't stand up for around 45 minutes
Hahahah
I haven’t been on rides since grade 12
And then fell over

I am very interested in the Master’s of Environmental Sustainability offered by the Institute of the Environment. This unique program provides an opportunity to further develop skills to approach multifaceted environmental issues, through influencing environmental policy and practise. As a student in Environmental Science, in the Global Change Option, I have been captivated by large-scale interdisciplinary issues. Further, I have an interest in the confluence of science and policy. 

Throughout my undergraduate degree, I have developed skills and gained experience related to this field. 
In terms of policy, I have experience through conducting a research project for the course "The Practise of Environmental Science". The resulting 30-page report was written with the goal of informing the creation of a document operationalizing parts of Canada's new Impact Assessment Act. In terms of research, I have experience producing large research reports, through many of my courses including Ecotoxicology and Environmental Issues. For my Environmental Issues course I produced a 20-page research report based on primary literature, which analyzed an environmental issue (bee decline) and compared approaches for its management. I also have experience in field data collection, gained via labs in geology and ecology, and through stream surveying for the local conservation authority.

In a professional context, I have experience considering the many dimensions of environmental issues through helping review and draft Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) reports. In addition, I have gained an understanding of the importance of the spatial perspective, through using GIS to present binational environmental systems in my co-op terms as a Geospatial Technician for the International Joint Commission.

I am reliable, a quick learner, and am confident that I would excel in this master's program. I am passionate about this field of study and look forward to starting this program.

Thanks again,
okay heres what ive got so far
wtf did you buy this
Shes still growing
She's only a child fin

Your language is really nice , but like specific experiences you've like had in the field?

cover letter
Like I need to essentially write a cove rletter
Hi Dr. Currie,

Sorry for the delay responding. Thanks for offering to write me a reference letter.

a) The letter process would done online and is entirely confidential. I would provide your contact email to the school, and you would receive a link to the secure online system to submit the letter. The only requirement would be a brief letter attesting to my potential for graduate-level study.

b) For sure, that is a great idea.

As PM, a pivotal part of my platform is making sustainability the forefront of  our activities as canadians blah blah. We need to ensure that our actions meet the needs of the present, without compromising the abilities of future generations to do the same. This line of thinking needs to extend across social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Blah Blah. Talk about how greenhouse gas emissions lead to greenhouse effect and global warming, which is harmful to all three of those dimensions.  It is the second largest threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. That biodiversity is intrinsically valuable, but also provides essential ecosystem services to canadians, like the trees provide lumber, the parks provide spiritual and cultural services, the wetlands stop erosion. The birds keep insects from eating our crops. BLAH Blah. Mitigating and adapting to cliamte change would have massive economic gains to Canada, despite its high initial costs. It is expected to cost much more in the future, through blah blah

I have like 5 3000 word essays on shit like this this semester
I'm angry that I even have to take this class
It's just it's worth NOTHING to me
like start the assignment as hello I justin trudeau
that would literally be the easiest assignment id ever have in my degree
can i just be justin trudeau
you legit have to state an environmental issue
I don't want to *write* things
I don't want to do it
its easy i mean
like
i was losing it at that
okay thats not a terrible assignment
It's worth 12.5% of my final grade
Hahaha
realistic scenario
lmfao
The premise for this application assignment is that you are the newly elected Prime Minister of Canada. During your election campaign, you stated that if elected you promise to take swift action to deal with one of Canada’s major environmental concerns.
Fergus, Farkle, and Felicia
Hahaha
it already has liver spots
the eyes are souless
why is this terrifying

lmao

green baby
This class is making me angry as hell
outdated is bad
From advice on green cleaning and eco-fashion toælessons on how to grow your own food and save water, this informative, fun guide details how individual lifestyle choices can make for a healthier planet. Written by environmental advocate and TV reporter Tanya Ha, this handbookæoffers simple steps that reduce daily eco-footprints at home, at work, and even while traveling. The bookÍs practical not punitive tips cover a variety of categories with such chapters as ñFood,î ñGreen Building and Renovating,î and ñHaving a Green Baby.î
Greeniology 2020 is the textbook we need
people didnt know climate change was happening until the 80s
for $65
outdated is not a good idea for anythign environmental...
Because the prof probably knows the person who wrote it
so you can live green correctly
also you can just ask me
why would you even need a text book for living green
Hahah
fuck you living green
i mean
i would never
21/25 on first quiz using a 15 year old outdated version of the textbook
they are just dumb enugh to
nah noone actually is
i dont understand how other people are????
i couldnt have a baby rn i could not handle a baby right now
but like
sams 21
and I DONT KNOW
she smokes bong with him right there
he just turned one and all she does is sit him in front of the tv and he was having a meltdown because he couldnt watch netflix because her ex cut them off his netflix and she was literally yelling at him to shut the fuck up
what is it with your grade and having kids at 19
it honestly breaks my heart
time for CPS
he cant walk or talk
screams at him to shut the fuck up when he's crying

I dont have to do that with you guys
the map is not easy to make
and yes
my brithday was
lmao
also holy fuck fin
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAaN-c5_20I&feature=youtu.be
Ur birthday was on Friday the 13th
Also I hate that subreddit
https://youtu.be/mUZiUC-kHj8
That map looks so complicated wow
https://www.reddit.com/r/IsTodayFridayThe13th/
I found an amazing subreddit everyone
most of those are coppies or not really useable. The are only a few good colours.
Ok there are more colours but look.
But yea. It takes a long time to get the lightning working. The bigest reason roll20 is a bitch is this: There is only 1 layer, you can only adjust items ontop of eachother by setting them either to the VERY bottom of the stack, or VERY top, you can only make rectangles and ovals, and there is only ~30 colours to chose from.
Anyway, here is another example of how the "boss fight" room looks from their angle. lots of nooks and crannies to hide in.
Well, this looks bad for jack. They look almost like eegs, and the hole to the side is too small it fit in. The place spells awful, and jack wants to run away, but for some reason he feels like something is watching him...
Thats blood allright. Something died here. And look, a path of it leading somewhere; maybe they cralled away, or something dragged a body? And what are those strange rocks...
But wait, whats that? Some cracks in the wall? Jack moves up to take a closer look. How strange... looks like there is a walkway, and... blood? uh, lets see where this goes.
You're jack. You walk into a room. Ah, bedding; this must be where everyone sleeps at night. Nothing interesting to loot here, no baddies either.
let me see if I can give an example of what its like from the players point of view
but
its not that purdy
when you can see it all
Now

Here is a screenshot of it; its a battlemap
Oh wow
for the past 5 hours I have been working on a single map
to give you and idea
well
you know how I said I have to spend a lot of time making maps
So
anywho
it looks rediculus
Hambone
and lol what even is that
you know how earlier I said I do a lot of work making stuff on roll20
We did this in class
https://gfycat.com/wellwornscalyamericancrocodile
Hey so fin or maybe it was nick
https://gfycat.com/blaringmealycoypu

Lmao
Then we got in a big circle and did hambone

Pls gif hambone
The prof said he knows a guy who does hambone and showed us a video of it
What
You would not believe what we just did in class
STUFF THAT TRIGGERS BRIANNA
mute the new chat
briana
But.......
Oh no I was mostly kidding
to not bother briana
so all a amth goes there
make a math chat
this is a million dollar idea
Nick
Lmao
All this math talk
This is triggering me
I can do that
Like the inputs outputs
avrage ennemy damage
and creating the UI would be hard
Can you draw me what the program would look lile
avrage ennemy ac
I could do the math but linking the databases would be hard for me
avrage party hp
Id say 25% programming, 70% math, 5% UI
avrage party ac
avrage party damage
you start with a basic
I think
That's like 1% programming 95% math, 4% UI lol
first we would need to extract every spell from the wiki into a database
in how many turns
figure out shit like how many owls would kill the party
and optional things like strategy and spells
By entering monster and party stats
What is it
Balance any DnD encounter
My kind of shit
Half math half coding
Yes?
Nick we have a coding assignment
Hi
Would need nicks help
itd be a program
in tandem with spell slots and level of characters
and would be used in the formula
that can be autoextracted from the wiki
thered be a database of spells
then they do nothing else
then they do a spell that kills 3 owls 3 times
thatd be in the database
next they do a smaller aoe for 2 turns
Spell slots baby
they cant the next
but
one turn
A spellcaster can fireball to kill a lot
We could sell this
Its a million dollar idea
Another thing to with spells
thered be a drop down list of each
or a specific strategy
like if you want to enter a specific spell that would be in use
So theres a bunch of OPTIONAL features of the calculator down below
hivemind
if enabled you assume the enemmie is smart enough to spread out or do whatever it takes to reduce damage against it
TActics enabled or disabled
You have two options
OR
you make the calculator simple
YOu dont
how do you calcualte that.
fireball kills 1 owl
what if they are not?
only if they are together
but
in a single blast
it WILL work
fireball could, for example, probobly kill 60 owls
your calculator fin
But anyway I was saying
:o :l :o :l :o
lol
the other two are rouges
the one chanting is the cleric
wtf are the other 3 doing
He's their leader
they are all fucked
The one eating the rat
of the 60
vs the party
those are the 4 that live
those
https://tenor.com/view/owls-gif-6212903
I think we should start collecting owls
......
yeah rip owls
Beating up the orcs
for the owls
its a suicide tactic either way
But what if we were also there
and even then
the owls lose
or stronger orcs
But if there were more orcs
We need to start collecting owls
....
the 60 owls could take out  a party of level 3 orcs
You will face 60 owls against Whoot, the owl god.
So if we were to befriend 60 owls
I have... A suggestion
at 1 hp left
Wait
if there were 59 owls, 1 party member survives with all owls dead.
So where are we going to find the 60 owls Sean
after 7 rounds
60 owls kills the party with 4 surviving owls
would kill our party
60 owls?
60 owls
So what was the outcome
https://tenor.com/view/extreme-bucket-demo-phil-swift-flex-seal-gif-10871835
I got mad confused last night when u guys started talking math

pls gif thats a lot of damage
AOE
lets say you have a fireball
there is one big thing tho
it could balance any encounter
I got some broccoli cheddar soup every1
but thats what microsoft excel is for
itll be complex as fuck
that includes Party HP pool, Enemy health, enemy stats (initiative, dpt), enemy attack strategy (focussed vs random), spells slots
gud luk
I will make a function for you some day shon
60 owls
nick reads the math from yesterday
lol
I hated doing limits
😱😱😱
*"Lets turn up the heat!"*

All I will say is this: Depending on your choices, if you wish to go for politics and bloodshed, guil and subtrafuge, theivery and wits, or any other combination you can think of, some of your choices might lead to a... Interesting event. In which, this theme could play (Forshadowing *ooohhhho*)
its a balance of how you wish to go about it
some more difficult
some quicker then others
there are porbobly a lot of ways to handle this
Might be a sulution
Possibly.
That full access should extend to the hammer
But the kobold king will grant us “full access” if we prove our trust
All he needs is his hammer. Thats about it. The kobolds have it, with Scorch wanting it the most for 'something'
I think we should gain full kobold trust then we could just walk in and take the hammer with no fuss
We can help him eventually in a logical way. But if it ruins anything related to kobolds that would suck
I want to help orvid
Everyone’s happy
Some orcs and plants die, some kobolds die
And fighting bad with bad is good for everyone
But there is likely more power to be gained with the kobolds
I think that there is very little good left in the world but orvid is a nice lad. So would be a shame for him to die
https://i.imgur.com/NOpxv2K.jpg
what WAS your plan? From Orvid, where did you want to go? (maybe talk to him a bit more) but there was going to return to Semol and fight some plant things, or going close to goblins and swamplands to find witch for Tek'osh, or saying fuck you kobolds, and visiting goblins (your goblin friend says this will go badly)
(thursday I belive)
Next session
Also
you do not want to go to the shadowfell
...and simply say "No." and leave you to rot.
You will wish death had taken you. You will pray for the cold embrace of his touch, to finaly end it all, and only at your lowest point shall death apear...

matts armour will protec him
***you do not want to go to the shadowfell***
do it just to spite you
I will repeate
you do not want to go to the shadowfell
'bye'
we instead use my lantern to go to the shadowfell
Roll20 needs EVERYTHING else
you guys just need music
Naw but I dont need to do everything but the last part
we decide not to see shrek
I have to do this 5 times
when
lthats literally us
if there are 5 locations
lol
loo
all of that for an area they MIGHT not visit
and and
I need to find music befitting the encounter or character (I have to do that for you guys too)
I need to make a map, drawn well enough to get points across
thats a -job-
they should pay you for that
so people can see it online
yes
ahhhh
I need to make its attacks and abilitys, and all of its statistics
it needs its HP, AC, and Vison set to its token
that I need to crop
aka needs art
every single creature needs a token
with roll20
with you guys I can just guestimate everything Hp and attack rolls, use pen and paper with dice
I am doing roll20 work
Anywho
you fucked up
fuck you
but if you forgot a major point of a speach
it can be a suprise moment, or you can drop it enterly and make something new up
and if you forgot something
they fill the gaps with their own mind
you dont need to be acurate
but when you weave a story
and you need to artuclate points well
when you give speaches you perpare them so there are no problems
that you wrote
Nah i improved my answer just now
you have words you need to say in an order
for it to be bad
how many people have to be in the room
public speaking you have a speach
Whats the limit
the difference is
But see
haha yes youre likely better now
I have improvd a 13 hour session. *13 hours*
improvization
improv
but I feel like my litteral years of training in improve would help a lot
I still do not like public speaking
and now I tell stroys out of my ass
I'd nearly faint whenever I spoke ifront of people
I know youve always hated it

pls gif anxiety
hahah
OOOOH NOOOO
voice quivering
youre getting anxiety thinking about it
hah
yes
OH NO
buplic speaking
i didnt realise
it was supposed to be a positive experience
Oh No
it was not the story he was looking for
said i only knew one person and then they retired
oh no
talk about experience with guberment
I got selected to talk about something ifnront of 150 people
so what happend that was emberessing
this year every single one so far is like 100+
All my classes last year were like 30 or less people
my smallest class had 14
7 per row, 22 rows
lotta people
yeah 150 i just did the math
maybe 60
think largest was like, 70
i was once in a class with 6 people
maybe 150
like 200+ people
im in the hugest class ive been in in years
ive somehow found a way to embarras myself in every class so far

Easy sleeping weather
Going down to 8 degrees tn
goodnight fin
goodnight shon
excited to play next week
anywyays
we didnt die but they put up a fight
which it was
at level 3 it was 'medium'
i put in CR 1 * 3 monsters
Huh looks like the orc encounter was accurate too
past*
so in other words, we were 50% pasty 'hard'
and 300 is hard
lol
ll
450, where 400 is deadly
well i like the fact that the XP shows you what XP amount is deadly
ahhhhhh
milestone system bitch
I dont use exp :p
it got us 450 XP
yes

ah
I belive a redcap is a cr 2.
what was the redcap cr
we had like 11 hp each
Cr ranges like this: cr 0, cr 1/8, cr 1/4, cr 1/2, cr 1, cr 2, cr 3 ... cr 20, cr 21, cr 22, cr 23, ... cr 30.
idk how we killed that thing when we were level 1
But
a big thing for the world is it is not really leveld to you; you can find stuff way out of your league.
for stuff like the red cap
also have you used this for our XP
imply
What does CR of 1 impy
but 4 tough goblins are deadly.
becasue it says 100000 is not a probloem for you to face
the formula is not perfect
but
that kinda intends to figure out hwats deadly and now
that is offical
Desired outcome, stats
there is a "Cr calculator"
See
and you get a balalnced output
where you just input the stats of the party and creatures
well shon if i ever procrastinate enough i may someday try to write you a function
fun math though
mattth
and spell slots
and if you count AOE spells
This question gets way harder if the owls focus fire
find number of owls that cause it to flatten RIGHT at 0
Imagine team hp over time

its finding out what parameters cause it to flatten at 0
The owls would block out the sun
yes
or flattens out i suppose
if you can imagine a logarithmic curve that approaches 0
So Im quite sure this is a "limitation" question
sight
imagine the site of 52 owls attacking at once after we have all used our turns
lol
so I could pin that message
wish we were in DND chat
a pack of 60 owls just kills the party.
at your current teir
SO
they deal 78.4 damage total
yeah
of the 60
4 owls live
Yea
well 7 turns i guess
thats an intense battle
8 turns
Sorry
So 60 owls win after 5 turns
that way leaves 1 person alive
because the owls HAVE to kill the party
yes
we round down
not realy
WELL
beacuse rounding
the party dies
60 owls
so then
so
hahah holy shit
59 owls (starting at 51) deal 75.6
or we could have just used calculus and figuerd this out the proper way ages ago
so you can count DOWN for each of 8 until you find the tipping point lol
but 57 deals 92
49 deals 70 damage
So its between 49 and 57 owls
1, 9, 17
start with 1 owl
until you reach 76
Actualy
like if you do 8 * 0.4 + 16 * 0.4
ah thats true
subtrace 8 each time
oh interesting if you work up backwards you can figuer it out
howd you calculate how many die
so we are looking in between there.
I can tell you 49 owls die, dealing 50.4 damage
yeah true
well, 50 means there were 58 owls
82.8 dmg dealt
50 * 0.4 + 42 * 0.4 + 36 * 0.4 + 28 * 0.4 +20 + 0.4 =
also
On turn 5
the owls win
oh man 50 is close
first if you look at above
Ok
better initiative
does the party reduce thwe number of owls by 8 FIRST, or AFTER
you assume party always attacks first
50 * 0.4 + 42 + 0.40 + 36 * 0.40... etc
as in
do the owls attakc first, or the party
this is important
Wait big question
if you start with 50 owls turn one
just remember multi turn
okay
I will work on brute force
but i can legit make a function to optimise it perfectly, I would just need to sit and think for 20 mins at some point
then its 6-4
just experiment until you get a reasonable number
12 turns, dead in 2, ~100 owls
yeah thats called the 'brute force method' which i use a lot
havle that
Yea, but
but youre dead in 1
itd take 24 turns to get rid of 198 for example lol
its close, but the party wins
we also know the party wins if 8xnumber of turns = number of owls
yeah its a logarithm
so basicly
and we know the party kills 8 owls each turn
just change damange and hp
and you can reuse it for any encounter
So we know half as many owls will kill the party it ALMOST 2 turns (they need a little more)
I can literally write out the limitation function for you if you want
We can use some rational thought to expand this
any less and its more than 1 turn
the owls can slaughter you in 1 turn at 198 owls
otherwise its a slaughter
haha yes we do
its the intercept
we know the turn number is greater then 1 lol
that x is the x0 (x knot) or initial x
I can brute force it though
yeah its rough math
so its as hp -> 0
x = 76
y is owls
sorry x is hp
yep
The only thing we have a set value for is party HP
thats why its a limit question
I know
We dont have a set number of turns
its as you approach 0 remaining owls

if you remember limits in math
thats a 'lim' question
but solving for owls -> 1
easy math
if you fix the number of turns its easy
Then I chuck a pepsi and say "Fuck it, they will figure it out."
Most times I end up saying "This will kill them."
spells and other things
and I have to facor in intelgience and picking of party members
If im making it balanced
an encounter comes up
every time
this is what I DO
its a logarithmic function
in DND
this is making encounters
because it changes per turn
THIS
it is
thats harder
HM
i was doing the reverse
or as close to a single owl as possible
hm interesting
with a single owl left
where the owls *just* win
lets see how close we can get
dealing*
Yes, so now
deadling 76 damage
will deal 0.4 damage each
the remaining 190
since if you kiill 8
76 / 0.40   +    8
thats the minimum number of owls to kill you in 1 turn
no matter what
they are not working together, just rampaging and hitting whatever possible
198 owls will kill you in 1 turn
meaning you all die at the same time basicly
Got it
Assuming they are dumb, they attack you all eqwualty
So 8 owls killed per turn
Oh yeah
I mean each of YOU kill 2 owls a turn
So 0.4 damage to the team pool per turn, per owl
the parties total HP pool is 76
well owls can only attack once.
Each
given that you kill 2 owls each per turn
so you can see how many owls would be needed to kill you in a given number of turns
its simply 0.4 damage per turn per owl
they HAVE to kill you
its like living with 1 hitpoint
because if you have a fraction, they need to do a little more
round up
or rather
We will round down for this.
you cant take fraction of HP
welll
(we are trying to remove AC from the equasion by avraging out effective HP)
Basicly, your HP pool is multiplied by 1.65, then multiplied by 0.95
(per living owl)
Damage per turn per owl
SO 0.30 * 1 + 0.05 * 2
aka 5% increase to their damage outbut
so 5% of the time its like you got hit twice
also, they deal 2 damage on a crit
so they need to ROLL 13
ah
yea, but they have +3 to hit
aka they hit on avrage, 35% of the time.
but AC of 16
so they need to roll a 13 to hit you
Owls deal 1 damage on their turn (each) if they hit, with a +3 to hit
damn
no
doesnt anyone remember some weird reddit poem about owls, owls
lets assume your party has an AC of ~16, each memeber has ~19 hp, and you can each kill ~2 owls a turn.
So
before u came into
some poem
a potato flew around the room
because a flock of owls that block out the sun is more terrefying
wasnt there a meme about an owl in a bedroom
oh
not crabs
when the crabs attack
for this experement
I actualy like to use owls
where are we
for you
what is the tipping point for crabs to become deadly
suffocate because theres so many crabs
what about cr 0.01
whats the tipping point
would you like
But
they are not cr 0 then
in an infinite number of crabs
thats different
what if they were big crabs though
So
so
they are CR 0, so in dnd terms, they are "never a chalange" even though that many would be deadly
an infinite number of crabs
Infinite crabs?
1000000000 crabs? not a sweat
1,000,000
you will have NO PROBLEM with 10000 crabs
its a CAKEWALK to handle 100 crabs
you can EASILY handle 10 crabs
make that into crabs
And, acording to default dnd encounter building
so....
a group of 5 goblin captins would probobly kill you
a group of say 12 goblins (that use tactics) might be deadly to you
If I was to theoreticly use the basic dnd rules for encounter building
how many tho

Let's throw our trash into space
theyre trying to relax
u leave the lads alone
stealing horseshoe crabs and their way of evolving 2 push their nastii theories
#creationists
but all pseudoscience is trash either way
some trash is more clearly trash than other trash
its all about how to deal with the trash
lol
those being there make it seem like its all cancer just cuz oh MAN
flat earth and vaccines cause autism
but i mean
oooh
they just have anti-science arguments for or against them
they arent all bad
why is that bad?
no its how to go about it in a proper way
also i thought we were trying to do something with mars
https://tenor.com/view/triggered-pepe-kek-gif-8902141
hahahaha theres literally a lesson for telling people to shut up?
I know this class will trigger me either way

i see ok
ooooh
debates on learning to combat pseudoscience
how do you even debate that with someone and like
why
no

<:run:590630295905108026>
;-;
a bad breakup
haha
i talk about it alot
fuck that course basically
by the end of last year i was so depressed by how shittily they treated me that i just literally straight up stopped going
tell everyone that most of us are probably going to fail on the first day
they treated u like shit on top of ur 4 hour days lol
the whole thing was kind of fucked
hard one
that fucking course
that was animation i had that 8 hour day
yes lol
thats nasty
oh man
then they expect u to go home and do another 4-5 hours of homework
with a few breaks in bewteen
I had an 8am to 10pm day
yepp
hahah regular work day grind
i had a day that was 8 am to 4 pm
bleh!
f to pay respects for those peopple
so technically a 6 hour class loophole
we have 1.5 and 3 hours. Sometimes though you have a 3 hour class back to back witha  3 hour lab of the same class, held in the same room
one day i was there for 8 hours
last 2 years all my classes were 4 hours
4 hour classes arent a thing at uottawa
https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/journey_cost.jpg
today
had a 4 hour todau
3 hours isnt that bad
good
rip
but not particularity
youd be back at like 7:30
monday is.... possible then
4pm - 7pm
thats long
8O
4-7
er no
4-6
what is 16 to 19
13-17?
1-5?
1pm
Im dumb
its 13:00
lol
That fucked me upo
wtf
look at the sidebar and scroll down
http://adamoliverbrown.com/2015/01/sci-1301-the-public-communication-of-science/
There's no reasoning for it
which is so dumb
yeah that's all offline
schedules, payment, enrolling, documents
lots of essential resources
still
ah
thankfully this isnt where u submit stuff
Brihgtspace is all day luckily
what about submitting an assignment at midnight
Because I had no idea when my exam was
And had to wake up early to do it
I've had to check my exam schedule for the next day before
thats hilarious
wttttf
it's really damn annoying lol
yes
is this every signle day
wtf lol
https://acsis.algonquincollege.com/students/time.aspx
just like the damn bank
come back tomorrow
open 8-5
sites have hours now
oh hahah wow
because they turned the site off
no its not
...
8O
can you see your schedule online?
andhhhhh i really hope i looked at it wrongggg
i completely forgot
im sorry i didnt realize
holy crap
She has a 5 hour class tomorrow
at least that is the morning for her
4 hours
that sucks
oh shit
Apparently she has a 6-10 class
oh damn how come?
Also Brianna can't even do it monday anyway apparently
lmao
i need beans to be a part of my life
So the reason i want DnD to be wednesday or thursday is because i dont wanna give up beans


Lmao
chris angel is teaching my class

The moment she started talking to me she was yelling
They're disrespectful is what they are
a cereal killer
maybe they are
Over fucking cereal
Someone just raised their voice at me
I was really confused
Neither did I
did not realise it was a sim
so thats not real right hahah
holy shit
This subreddit sim post fucked me up

now it's getting confused by of/off
lol
It doesn't know what is correct
its really confused
wtf pages
what

But god damn does it ever suck
during school
I remember how hellish it is from when I worked at loblaws
it gets a bit easier
And the first time having to provide proper customer service while I'm 2 minutes away from passing out
And the first time working weekdays while going to school
It's been a very long time since I've worked while this tired
np!
Ok cool thanks dude
but try to avoid standalone layers
and 1.2.2
you have a 1.2.1
IF
sometimes thats okay
Oh good idea
like dont have a 1.1.1 if theres no 1.1.2
theres no other items
dont have numbers IF
there is such a thing
I do that too
hahahah
is this too many layers deep
\
Hey <@!331154975457673228> is there such thing as too much numbering in a report
Damn haha
Yeah like... 4 classes
do you do any video editing
Which gets my dick hard af
I could work in documentaries
Hard not to find job opportunities from it
Coop is great
Plus co-op
No but I can start like.... Looking
Ahhh you don’t have a particular one lined up you mean, but yeah I def think you can find one
The job page for this course is 11 pages long
Like ... I can get so many jobs
Ohhh nice
It would be a graphic design contract
Where would that be?
If I play my cards right
I can get a contract as early as the end of the semester
I hope you get away!
If you can’t swing it I’m willing to commit to 6:30 Mondays
I might not have to be here much longer at all
Luckily
But
I'm just kinda scared of Walmart
Yeah, I'll see about asking for Thursday off
A solid routine is best so we can plan around it
Like we can do 6:30 worst case
This week is good and I thinkkkk next week is also okay
I'll work this out u guys don't gotta worry 😎😎😎😎😎
But don't worry
😎
It's a want that I need
I feel bad I don't wanna change that once since it's not a NEED it's a want but >>>>>
Or relaxing if I need it
Where i have nothing to do so I can spend the day on homework
Plus homework day
I would too
Yeahhhh
Makes sense
Ah you want your days off in a row
No I'm not going to move that because it's a day off for me
Like but that one can’t be moved?
Always
Yes
Like you have Tuesday’s off always though?
This week is fine
But im not sure yet
I was thinking possibly taking it off as well
Chances are someone won’t be free
Because nick might have work too so switching is not good
No :(
Hmmmmmmm. So you can’t move your day off for sure then? Not an option?
So id be okay if you guys wouldn't mind if we occasionally switched between Wednesday and Thursday?
probs woud start at like 8pm often
And I feel like it's unlikely I'll work both Thursday and Wednesday
and thats earliest possible
I don't work this Thursday
getting there at 6:30 sucks
But!!
Tuesday so I can have a sleep day and Monday because I actually need Monday
no thats the only reason i was voting wednesday or thursday is because we can start at a reasonable time
And I need my Mondays and Tuesdays
I thought we still had to start on 6:30
Ooooh
Because I don't know if I can book it off :((
Trade off
Ahhh
Well Thursdays are pretty alright, only thing is I might work sometimes
Wed + Thurs we can do 5
Oooooh ok ok
Monday + Tuesday its 6:30
Matt doesnt actually have that lab
Thursdays we can start whenever
Oh why that late
Just if we can't start until 6:30 isn't that the same for Monday?
On Thursday?
and I think the consensus was thursdays are best but we won't be able to start until 6:30
😦 shit
Like I'm a bit confused I'm so tired
Also I'm so fucking beat
Wait what's the plan for d&d

I need to choose a programming language to use
I already have a report I have to write
https://tenor.com/view/best-gif-6151063

White knighting Algonquin college
Its like ur fresh out of highschool aren't u
That’s so annoying
Then the professor has a coffee
This one fucker told me to put my closed drink away that I sat down for a minute to get my laptop out because I was going to get in trouble because we're not supposed to have drinks in the classroom
I just got back from a similar situation where I was sat beside people I wanted to hit
do these people has aspergers
"will i be penalised if my referencing software fights with me"
they need to stop asking so many questions
and they are meant for each other
these two are sitting next to each other
oh god
asking questions about whether the prof likes the oxford coma
such annoying people
OH man
whyyyyyy
;-;
phone was on silent lol
sorry
oh shit
Plz
Nick
Yeah those kinds of people are the worst
lmao
looks up from his phone game every once and a while to argue with the prof
but yet is asleep half the time
guy who just wont stop talking
yeah sounds familiar
lol
Though he'd argue with the prof after asking a question on something he clearly didn't understand
I had a guy like that in one of my classes minus the offensivness
:/.
then asks horrible borderline offensive questions
doesnt pay attention to class at all
he just asks the dumbest questions
i remember him from natural resource management
who is it
oh nooo
uh oh
he is the worst
Oh nooooo I have this guy in my class
Seems like an easy class
My memory for that kind of thing is terrible
lol
I'd fail it
yeah that's kind of dumb
I just find it funny that its a memorisation test
so quite a while lol
19 days
do you even have time to learn that
already?
jesus
worth 7.5%
I have a test on place names in polar regions on Sep 23
very hard
hahah nice

Two classes are geneds which will be a joke
<:1_:608814157751517212> <:2_:608814157634207757> <:3_:608814157747322885><:4_:608814157495533579><:ye:591002869881372705>
the end is in sight
I really want to graduate
nah
Because 20 hours
It's dumb though because one of my classes counts as two
Will you drop any once you get phireligjtt
Oh jeez
technically i'm in an overload situation actually
Ahhh damn
nah I have all of them
So you only have one class for now
I was thinking of an HTC vive

I don't care much about it being school, I hate the fact that i'm cold
Who else is sad that it’s school time
That’s a good chance
Haha nice
Basically everything else is the same though
*html*
Now it's just
you don't have to do that huge <!DOCTYPE > line anymore
Haha they made it a bit better since comtech
they changed this trash language
tf
i was like
ooh i see i see
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title for the tab</title>
  </head>
<body>
  <h1>This is some big text (header 1)</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
so like
<html> starts a document
<h1>is for big text</h1>
<html> </html>
but how i learned was just
its <h1> </h1> i think
APPARENTLY however
<p> cock and ball torture </p>
Bizniz

Yes
But you and Annie binged it before haha
Yeah!
We were going to watch it together
It's so happy-sad
I think so
Quite possible
Didn't Brianna get you to watch it
It’s highly associated with fall for me, but I only watched it last year for the first time
Yes! Love that show
Did you guys ever watch over the garden wall?
And hahah
Yeah I'd move out
https://youtu.be/WJeeA_O88Zw
Also saw one in my room which I did not like
Bad in the bathroom
How are the roaches fin
Basically
Lmao
Briana: High
But me sad as well
we need briana
Hahaha yes
So our feelings on fall:
Me: sadness (end of summer)
Shon: happiness (cooler)
Nick: fear (spiders)
Like the size of my index finger nail
I found a really big beetle the other day though
Yeaaah I still think I'd take this over that
Like the cockroaches
They've multiplied
I killed two a few days ago too
I killed three
I would hate that
I'm lying here afraid they'll eat me
Oh man
Hahaha
just ask them to pay rent or get out
Like a fucking million of them
And I found out that daddy long legs had like a nest behind my bed

Because he got away
spooder
Now
That's got me all paranoid how
Lazarus, Prophet of Mehkane.

In book 7 yeah that was tragic
Especially when she was so far into her pregnancy
It broke my heart when she miscarried tho ;-;
but it was so nice that Hazel sang to him and said ideas cant die as long as they are remembered
But it was sad/touching to see the imaginary grown up kid fade away
That was book 7!
Alana loses her baby :(

Hahahah the one about the climate change denier?
Hello,

I am writing to the department to explain my disappointment with GEG 3306, Quaternary Paleogeography, offered in Fall 2019. Many of my peers have been excited for this course, but unfortunately I will be dissuading them from enrolling in it with the current professor.

As Dr. Ian Clark put it himself "Science is advanced by the discourse between differing views". Scientific skepticism is healthy and necessary in order to improve our understanding of the topic in question. However, Dr. Clark has a clear history of bias towards arguments against anthropogenic climate change, having spoken in support of many of the most popular climate myths. Much of this information has been consolidated into a database, which can be found at https://www.desmogblog.com/ian-clark. 

As a result, despite Dr. Clark's portfolio in paleoclimatology, I find it inappropriate that he teaches a class that deals with "Scales of climatic change and impacts on the global environment". After taking his course in Quaternary Geology and Climate Change, I feel that his views do interfere with teaching a representative coverage of the science that exists in this field.

Ultimately, a department is only as good as it's professors. 

Sincerely,

Findlay Yates-Lavery (8230390)
Also I sent a strongly worded email to the department just now because im drunk and found it in my drafts from a month ago
that I can dodge bullets?
why...
lmao
omg when he phones him
No neo...
that i can doge bullets?
What are you trying to tell me?

I don't wanna be Norton!!!
Why am I Norton
I just want a few more 30* days

Oh man I’m not quite ready for it to be colder than 18 degrees out as a high
lmao
lmao the magnet

yeah, I guess so
guses youre just a house now
and lmao

apparently
guess youre a house now
and wow
i think youre right
I don't have a damn unit number
And it won't let me put no unit number
And I said i'm in an apartment
Also i'm trying to update my address on my license
A full reinstall may be in order
yeaah
computer is a tad fucky
Hahaha
so not sure what happened
yeah it said "updating"
Oh damn I thought you updated
im still on high sierra somehow baby
idk if i like it
how do you like the dark theme on mac os mojave fin
so you can't use it
the other one isnt even on the card
yeah im happy about splitting mine up
Especially when it's all in the same account
I hate it because I can't easily know where I am at with money
while knowing if i spent it im fucked
Yeah
it sucks having the illusion of having money
Yeah that's what i'm thinking lol
any earlier is ridiculous lol
start applying 2 months out
Yeah
Like I don't think a company would like that
nah its too early
I don't even know if that's good advice or not lmao
they suck
And haha strsss dreams
idk why I dreamt that
noone to bail me out
I had a dream where people were telling me I should start applying to jobs now and say I can start in January
its because if i do run out im super fucked
yeah so thats why its split into two accounts lol
Ah damn man
Must feel good to have rent paid for for so far ahead
i will actually run out of money if i dont get a job in january
nice
then the rest is for rent for the next 6 months
and $480 on my credit card
mines going down by like $4k at least in a few days lmao
i feel that
$0.41 in my chequing
Ahhhhhhh
But it's Brianna's share of rent for the next four months
$1780 in my savings
I have an inflated bank account too
the $18 is what is accessible to me for like food and stuff lol
holy fuck lol

and havent paid the band yet
I got paid for the concert by the venue
AND
Also I have gotten OSAP and havent paid tuition
and everyone has paid me rent and bills, but it hasnt been taken out of my account yet
how much is in your account total?
because im the guy who pays the bills for our house
the amount of money i have right now is extremely inflated
So
lmao
what's that?
oh man
i paid cash baby
BB may be able to do that
I know home depot can look up your receipt using the card you paid with
Well
lmao
yet the source emailed me a receipt when i bought batteries
when my headphones broke i couldnt find the receipt even though i pent an extra 20 n warranty
so I never do it
true
hah but thats a hassle
or return it
And get most of my money back
I just think that I could sell it if I don't like it
Hahaha
so new things just seem like too much responsability
im alwasy worried about:
a) losing the new thing
b) forgetting i own it and not using it
c) realising i dont like it much anyways
I have like $0.10 right now
i know what holds me back from buying new things
but rip my savings
lol
If I have the money and plan on getting the thing at some point anyway...
in my mind, it's just like
Theres so much stuff I could justify replacing
hah nice
it was a cheap chinese one from ebay
thats why my monitor is still dark
noooo i need that
lmao
oh yeah fuck where did that go
oooof

Also how's the adapter I gave you?
damn
yes
fuck lol really?
My mouse dongle thing has open circuitry lmao
My Thunderbolt - HDMI cord broke so one monitor is just off
:D
and are being used instead of my speakers which burnt out and popped last year
My headphones are being held together by an elastic band
lol nice
I've used my MacBook more than my desktop
Yeah, and I haven't even played many games on it haha
since it was such a hassle anyways
AH yeah
That's the only one I regret
I shouldn't have got the computer upgrade
My ThinkPad I bought used 5 years ago so it was old lol
Macbook was great purchase
And maybe MacBook
TV is the only jusrifyable one
meanwhile my speakers have been dead for a year now sitting under my desk
I think thats it
oh man yeah
$650 MacBook, $450 TV, $70 VR headset, $300 Switch, $400 processor, $180 SSD
Processor
Switch
4k TV
I bought
Hahaha
Most expensive purchase ive made in the last 3 years was probably my PS4 for $300
I bought like 4 or 5 really expensive things in four months lol
But
That's how I justify it
I buy things I've wanted for a really long time
but I do waste more money on food than the average person
I dont impulse buy.... 😦
Yes
and my dad
Just like ur dad
haha
So I can keep impulse buying random things
And then make money
I just wanna get school over with
Nice same here
Excited for D&D and smash
Yep! And yeah!
DnD tomorrow!
so you may go into renfrew at some point? Your classesa lso start wednesday eh?
Fucking hell
doubt they had in 2 months
jeez

I've paid more in insurance than my car is worth
Yeah
but in those cases its needed
Imagine having to pay off the car after it got destroyed
i hate insurance
But it's good that it got replaced
It's going to be so expensive after buying a whole new car
yeah
Rip that guys insurance
So insurance is sometimes worth it i guess
I think so
Will it be fully replaced?
2019 Leaf electric car
Holy crap
it was only 2 months old
Fuck
Oh shit really?
wrecked
Annie's parents new car was rear ended a week ago
jeez
I think it's a broker or something but I haven't talked to the person in years
I don't even know who does my insurance I just pay ot
I know it's so complicated
Which is weird because I just got my new insurance
cars have so many strings attached
oh damn
Said the cop
Apparently without new stickers I'm uninsured
good point
Then just show it to the cop if I get pulled over agaib
oh nice
Like a receipt
I think I may order a new one online and then get some kind of confirmation that I did
But
So just wait
They send it in the mail lol
i think my dad just did anyways
well i mean how are you supposed to drive to get the new permit
yikes
Was supposed to go into Renfrew today but not sure if we even can nos
I think so
new colour for every month eh
damn
lmao
I guess he pulled up right behind me at a light and saw the colour of the sticjer
Luckily the police dude was super chill
how did they know to pull you over?
Like 116 or something
My dad has been pulled over for that too
>$100
they expensive?
Yeah
So you need to buy new ones
They expired july 9th :(
Ahhhh I see
Oh yeah sorry thought that was clear
What do you mean? was it the stickers?
And I just can't drive it
They pulled us over literally right in front of our apartment

welcome to the club
I am an unemployed lad
So no more CSC
jeez
One semester will have put more towards my whole loan than any other semester
fucking doug ford
It'll be like $19k
Which would suck as that means the $15k isn't final
maybe it hasn't updated yet for the next semester
you shouldnt have to while still enrolled

ill have to in winter too
forgot about repayment...
thatd odd
oh wow
wew!
what the hell
I have to start paying my loan back November 1st apparently
(loan)
I got an additional $1000
also my OSAP got recalculated
But I think it'd work well
It may be hard for some questions that are complicated
I think that'd be good
"Do yo support proportional representation / electoral reform?"
Yes, no, pass
"Do you believe climate change is a big concern for Canada?"
Yes, no, pass
"Are you pro-choice?"
and they get like 2 passes lol
where they -have- to answer with a simple yes or no.
a 'yes or no' round of questions in a leaders debate
i just thought of a genius idea
also
love that
haha
Guy Fieri is in ottawa
I be outside
lol
I'm going to leave early eitherway

guess so lol
Hahaha did you put pumpkin seeds in it?
we had a pumpkin grow out of our compost once
yeah
Would be neat to watch a timelapse of it
odd
and eggshells
Hahaha yeah it's od
its kinda weird how a pile of bananas and salsa and mold and pickels and papertowel becomes lucious soil in a year or two
without buying soil from somewhere else
that toop
also allows you to reuse it as soil
Circle of life
yes
waste diversion
Less stuff in dumps
ye
less trash
why is it environmental my lad?
dun
let pile rot
put old plants in pile
lol
I shouldn't need to even read anything

@everyone

do you know what time it is
guys
lol
This wiki is actually the funniest thing I've ever read
https://muc.fandom.com/wiki/Arthur_Morgan
https://youtu.be/OFjqEexH0Tg
did we ever see him murder anyone who was as rich as he was other than paul allen?
because he definately keeps alot of his bodies but like where did he get them all, a lot of the people he killed were prostitutes and homeless people
i dont know how to take that part though
like i was losing it like OOOOHHH OHHHHH
that had me reeling
written on the walls
fuck you yuppie cunts
and no that was scary
.... a little funny in its absurdity
but if cinematically my murderer was naked with only his shoes on because he of course made sure to put his shoes on chased me and then HELD THE RUNNING CHAINSAW above and aimed it to drop directly down onto me which you would think,, would go in my head but goes into my side and im lying beside the stairs somehow
Everything is pristine until you open any other door
All the bodies in the closets
oh yeah terrifying
like what the fuck
it goes in her side
go in her head
and it doesnt even fucking
Imagine if that was you
to drop it on her head
and .... aiming the chainsaw
That’s terrifying
completely naked
Brianna no
cuz he was like
i ... thought it was kinda funny
With the chainsaw
oooh
Yes
That*
hat girl 😮 like the escort?
The part where he was chasing hat girl was awful
i genuinely enjoyed it which is weird because i dont really like movies where people get hurt but...
really really good movie
but no though
was his business card flawless
was it worth more than yours
did his apartment overlook central park
Probably honestly
did he get fucking reservations at dorsia
No
did you kill him
There was a guy named Paul Allen at my old job
the person he hates the most
but not paul allen
like a ton
He hallucinates it all
like oh yeah no he's killed a TON of people
Yeah hahah
i just think it would be SO fucking funny
But I think it ending ambiguously makes us question that, which is a comment on the fact that we even have to question that in our society
and yeah i think so too
and the bullshit story he made up for him going to london because he killed him but he didnt even kill him, he just..... went to london
But I think he did it, it was covered up, because he is rich and powerful
so much
like he hates him so fucking much
Or it was a hallucination lol
But if they do then that’s a comment as well. And if we have to question it, that in itself is a comment
would be even funnier
which i think
if thats the case, some people think he never managed to kill paul allen
We don’t know if the lawyer knows or not
We don’t know if the cop knows about him or not
We don’t know who covered it up for him
True
because books end ambiguously better than movies
apparently it stands better as a book than a movie
Interesting
might have to read it
it was originally a book
Lmao
mind ur own business the atm is hangry for cat
She gave her life to save that cat
Lmao
yeah but fuck the old lady
The lady only complained because he had a gun against the cat
he didnt i appreciated that i did not have to see that
he didnt even he could have then proceeded to kill the cat
killed the lady but not the cat
He wanted to
loved that
he didnt kill the cat either
Ducking psychopath
Yes lol
feed me a stray cat
Chainsaw scene scarring
i liked feed me a stray cat
Business card scene was hilarious
definitely a HUGE commentary
Like the business cards
Parts of it was
i just kinda thought it was like.. really funny
It’s a comment on reality
something something yuppie culture
But based on reality
Yeah of course
its satire
hilarious
i thought it was like
i really liked it
The part about everyone else being so oblivious was really unsettling to me
Jesus ha I did not like that part
and some people wanted to know just WHERE he'd gotten that overnight bag
and went and got rid of the body
and then smoked a cigar by his dead body and listened to some boppin jams
... still bad but i liked it when he murdered paul allen and said who has reservations at dorsia now
cathartic at one point that was it not the whole movie
It was amazing
Brianna calls this movie cathartic
Why does Brianna like this movie
Just casually kills a homeless man and dog
i was scarred
yyyyyeeea
This is fucked
Oh yeah
Because <@331154975457673228> hyped it up so much
So I'm going to watch America psycho
Wow that's fast
4

damn
It kind of seems like this is just suicide?
Like he said that today
And scheer said he wants to bring us back to the harper days
Conservatives are literally using stephen harper as a selling point
and uh oh
yeah
Can you scan it then sign it at work?
https://youtu.be/tAAiQsK8KiM
im so mad that i didnt end up getting the thing signed
She's a pretty odd cat overall
Probably lmao
she has schizo
She will meow at me until I do that
easy fix
thats hilarious
Then pour it back in front of her
I empty it and show her
oh yeah
That's what I do
and haha
just pick it up and put it back down
She won't eat until i do that
and lol
It makes no sense though. I'll just pour her current food into the bag and then pour it back into the bowl and then she eats it
yeah the free version doesnt work
She demands fresh food
Kenya will not eat dry food that has been sitting out
But there's a free version
Literally only acrobat works
I remember it
Elections ontario
I dealt with this for electuons
Yeah
Wait
Actually
except Adbobe Reader
Thats really stupid
Ah fick
cant be viewed in fucking anything
nah its some bullshit encrypted PDF shit
Or use the online ms word
Can you import it to google docs
Dunno why it's for Windows at all
im mad
Linux and windows
fuck it
Just going to use the Pro editor at work tomorrow
Windows*
It's for Linux and Mac...
Wait no it's avince
I think that's what it is
Look up gnome evolution
I do but idk if it's Linux only
Hmm
Ay sorry
and justice has been served
boom acrobat just got uninstalled
do you know an open source PDF editor <@!136253782131474432>
so you can just add images to PDFs
at work they have Adobe Pro
So I think i know how I did it last year
buracuracy
that sounds a lot like
when technology cuases more of a hassle than its worth
it would legit be easier to walk to fucking staples and get it scanned
thats so fucked
this shit is caused by the form being created in a different version
omfg
i fucking did this last year
that shit greyed out
It wont let me add god damned signatures
dont you have to pay for that
Adobe Acrobat solves all issues
its one of those complex PDFs with specified fields n shit
and no it made me install adobe reader
I have a track pad it should work
Does it not work in preview
I dont know how to fucking sign a PDF
but thats not what happened
i called circe K Macs today
Oh no what happened
im dated
im too old
its happened
I am no longer tech savey
I need help 😦
It's just terrible
yea 😦
Tells you what you don't want to know
I don't like that he lost a bunch of fur
thats horrible 😦
Aww
It's just a terrible accident that happened I guess
But I told them
I mean it's not their fault
I told them not to let him outside
Sorry for your loss Brianna
So sorry to hear that
Omg no 😦
He was only year old
He had no fur around his ribcage and neck
And I guess it crushed him or suffocated him
He got caught under the fence
Budders
My cat at home died
The end of it was really depressing
So many deaths
Jesus Book 7 was a doozie

That would be nice of him if hef let you
asking the other guy if i can take his parts out
I want to use this one paper i wrote but its 'jointly' written
Shit what will you do?
but i didnt do one
Nah most people use their Undergrad thesis
Are you expected to quickly whip up a 20 page report for this?
Yeah and I dont have anything thats 10-20 pages long that isnt jointly written
That's a lot of work
Ooooh boy

this is intimidating as fuck:
i can move my head and it stays
this is working suprisingly well so far
didnt have tape
That's a fairly tidy way of doing it I guess
Oh boy

May not stay fixed
It uh
it stoped
<:sadshrek:591001826116239360>
:(
but I know if i tilt my head or the wind blows itll stop working
the clamp has worked for a whole song
I've never managed to be able to fix them when that starts happening
I tried all the fixes on two seperate headphones
It probably is
and at this angle it touches
I legit think the wire is completely broken
It's all riled up
You gotta calm it down
Yeah hahahah
lmao massaging the wire
huh
Apparently that can fix it
You can also try like massaging the exact spot
It's a kink in the wire
Ah yeah that would do it
and lmao
That came off more theat like than I meant
at field course
it started when i was running and the wire got caught on a doorknob
Would suck to lose em
Your headphones look pretty nice
I hope it works man
Hahaha
lets see how long this lasts
I pinned the wire at the correct angle using a little clamp thing lmao
I know lmao
I also love when he runs from the kid
Arthur just says "Okay"
love that part
Lmao when he throws the fish on the table and then they all glitch out

I had something like that before
Have to walk to campus twice
Not a fan of Monday’s

So my new commute would be 88 > 91/94/95 > train > walk 10 blocks
According to my coworker
All busses coming in from outside downtown will be replaced with the train
Apparently no busses will go right downtown besides the 1-10 busses to try and help with congestion
oh what
this sucks
But the train doesn't go anywhere close to my work
Only to tunneys pasture
the 91,94,95 and 270s will no longer go to the core
my bus is being replaced from tunneys pasture with the train as soon as it opens

Like it's a simple question deserving a simple answer
Yeah that's super shitty lmao
thats how he responded to every question i had
isnt that a shitty response though
Beats me
Hahaha why does your supervisor know so many old stories
Me: "Hey, I'm not sure who to email about this, and I don't think I can get this all done in 1 week, theres [all this] left"

Supervisor: "This is the old story of the balancing act between the 80-20 and needing to manage diminishing returns, a good exercise in time management, shift focus if you need to, but have this wrapped up for the end of your term" *Retires*

Michel: "No, you definitely can't be expected to complete all of that, let's brainstorm how we can move forward with this and hand this off, send me an email with the status of the problem, and we will talk about it together"
shows me what i missed out on all term
also i hateeeee how when i go to talk to ANYONE other than my supervisor, its refreshing how much less socially inept they are, an dhow they are normal to talk to, and reasonable people
lol
40 minute bus ride for this

He was the king of /r/comics for the longest time and everyone loved him and then everyone turned on him at once
the memes werent even FUNNY
but then everyone took a steaming ass dump on it and i was like ????
He's gone through a lot
i liked that one
Yeaaaah
his comics are kinda meh lately
i think he just had a fairly chill ass disposition then power of suggestion made him MORE depressed then he (possibly was) previously because everyone was calling him a fucking BETA MALE
I hope Shen is doing better
Yeah
Person*
He just trying to be a positive prison
then he left for a really long time and came back and said he was depressed
theyre like this is a sign of how depressed u are

oh boy
Yes let's do it
Presents Matt's limp character to the collector
lol
Like oh yeah our friend wants to
While Matt's away we sell his soul to the collector
OOOOOH
it was the price for something in his collection.
rather
They chose to do it
Nope
Did they have to sell their soul to make him not mad anymore?
What did they do anyway
and yep
oof ouchie my bones
So any fun new thing he can't keep
And oof yeah that does kinda suck
Sorry that send late
And also the pain that came with it
touch all your enemies
running around touching stuff
youre just a naked being
thats pretty severe
He collects it.
He owns everything you touch.
Lollllll what happens when you sell your soul
And HAH all I did was sell my pinky
I'll totally be friends
he just wants to be f r i e n d s
Skct 😄
Skct
somone sold their soul to him
then
pissed him off
They uh
What did the other party do with collector lad anyway
We love making friends
but if you did maybe you could become his f̹͂͠ȓ̏̒ĭ̒ͣe͉̝n̐ͫ͗dͨ͒̓ ͥ̂̉:̎D̏̉̔
and i doubt you'd even go to where Skct is. Its really out of the way
mostly
Your party has a tendency to befriend things
I mean
Our line of logic is I don't even know
Haha our line of logic
Its unlikly you guys will ever see Skct. Due to your partys line of logic and way you have progressed.
or a way to kill Skct.
they dont want to. I belive they are working on an escape plan.
This is uh...
Well, the other party is *dealing* with this.
Skct is very terretorial.
Is it in the process of laying eggs
Is
He looks like this. His name is Skct 😄

Bzz
and i only just got half way through it----
ive been reading a 600 page book of pure lore for the past 4 months


then i had to let him go
I was just letting him relax in my hand in the water when i saw the leech getting friendly with my toe
I love catching frogs, they like to chill in your hand when they realize your warm
>:(
He made me lose my frog though
Well a brownish red but very clear
Perfect pattern and everything
Red spots?
Lol
Because this leech was like... Other than being a leech absolutely lovely like he was a perfect leech
If given enough food and time
Wonder if they can just get that big
He looked perfect tho actually
Ahhh
In the wetland module
No not that big hahahaha
Oh
I saw one longer than like a pencil
Then tortured him a little bit with a stick
Grabbed his mouth and tore him off me
So I pried him off
Dang
In between my toes
Lol
Yes! A big one
Leech
No no like got on me
Paints
Cuz see 90% of the time i was there was just me an Stacey catching frogs
Scratching makes them worse
OH but guess what I did get actually
:(
You don’t lol
It’s better now
Scratch it
How do you like
Oh no
Odd
Of my ring finger
That's
Oh..
I got one on my finger print
Just mi leggys
None on my arms surprisingly
Nah long sleeve helps
But your probably worse
I'm covered
I have bites on my hands and ankles
Mosquitos don’t give a shit about bug spray
Bugs, ticks, scrapes
And mosquitos
Ticks
Cuz
Awww yeah I guess not
Short sleeves aren’t practical for field work
I tried to get one but I did a bad job
Have had no wear long sleeves every day
Bet you have really nice one now hahaha
Yeah it was really nice got a little tan
Wow nice
Hahahaha
Some day you’ll have a normal sleep schedule
I was at Stacey's cottage for 3 days!
I was really tired
Yeahhhh
Hahaha it was really nice so worth it
4 hours is so long
Bugs and sunburn
So no sunburn
Like sleeping outside is not great
But shaded
Yessss
In a hammock
Was it in the sun
4 hours is a full sleep
Hahahahaha
Otherwise it was a fabulous nap
And also the poop would interfere
Even that is super uncommon because ideally they want a way out
Cuz that is literally my nightmare and hahahahaha it's okay
But I have been non stop thinking about ticks in butts and ears
Haha well I’m sad you were stressed about that still
Also I'm kidding I'm not actually mad hahahaha
Oh! Good!
Nope not engorged
No one has been bitten
But our of 35 kids each spending every day in the forest for 8 days
Ahhh!! Were they fat?
Three ticks were found in a shower at field camp
Cuz I mentioned it to Stacey like hours and hours later and she was unimpressed
I highly doubt you do
Or my butt
I don't have a tick in my ear
Neither did I
Well
And did not get any ticks
I was literally out in the deep tick infested woods for 5 straight hours sampling a quadrat today
Then convinced myself I had a tick in my ear and stayed up all night because I was scared
Lol
I was sleeping and then I woke up kinda groggy and my ear felt funny and it was like -_-.... O_O
We have to do tick checks every day
I’ve been trekking through the forest all day every day and haven’t even gotten a tick
I was so scared!!!!!
Nooooo
Hahaha whhhattt
Hammock wouldn’t have ticks but you’d probably get eaten alive by mosquitoes
I PANICKED ALL DAY AND NIGHT THAT THERE WAS A TICK IN MY EAR OR MY BUTT
After that
They like places to hide
And
I went to staceys cottage and fell asleep in a hammock for four hours
Read about it happening to a guy once
Yes
Yes
Going in your ear and your butt
Uh was I
The other day
Remember when you were talking about ticks
Why
😠😠😠😠
<@331154975457673228> !!!!!!!!!
I have a bone to pick with you mister!!!!
Haha I would be so fucking mad

Pretty sure those are trees
Plants so big we're gunna need a saw to cut it down



Or playing guitar
All SFW, mostly people's pets
So far it's really hood
Also how do you stop people from going on and being super hate crimey
Is AI advanced enough to instantly cut off the feed if it detects a penis
Also who thought public access on the internet was a good idea
rip

literally like 7 clicks
Are you actually making any modifications

Not even a minute to do two
Haha
i got too fast and broke my trend

true
Unless you want a two hour bus ride in
lol yeah
Good luck affording a room anywhere though
Axel wanted to go there
i shoulda gone to like UBC
Haha
but worse in sciences lol
I think they have better course selection
Not sure
DO you know if carleton is much better?
Lots of problems, some I think are just kind of expected from university/college
nope
Oh man I thought you just left somethign in the textbox
My problems with uOttawa:
1. No physical (real/scientific) anthropology courses at all, despite like 10 social anthropology courses.
2. No scientific archaeology courses (only classical concerning egypt/roman/greek) despite Ottawa being situated in an area of archaeological significance with relation to indigenous sites.
3. Courses only offered once per year if you're lucky, sometimes in alternating years or not at all, ontop of an already limited selection.
4. Climate change denier teaches climate courses.
5. Seemingly no awareness or concern for multidisciplinary degrees or interests, with courses like "Environmental Policy requiring 5 prerequisites in policy. In other words its not a two way street, it should be policy knowledge for environmental students, IN ADDITION to environmental knowledge for policy students.
6. Classes are always full.
7. Greedy competitive so does not let take electives from other schools.
8. Fees like insurance impossible to opt out of.
9. Do not give you your scholarship if the term AFTER you earned it isn't full time studies as well.
10. There's always an hour wait to talk to a human at customer service.
11. They make you pay a fortune in co-op fees.
Haha it's a stressful time
Lol im constantly angry
Yeah, seems to be really lacking
how about the cheap fucks just run enough classes
yes
I guess maybe they prioritize political students
are you like blocked from it?
why
'
😦
shit course options
its full
why not?
fucccck uottawa
I cant even take Intro to Political Science
Fuck uOttawa
else*
Desktop for games, macbook for everything
I don't really like sitting at my desk much
I'm using it as my main computer honestly
Hahaha definitely
Its a sexier portable netflix machine by far
Decent
So now befoer I sell the next laptop I only paid $300 for the upgrade
pays for half your macbook
Yeah definitely
still pretty good
wow nice
Still have the other laptop to sell
less than what I thoguht it would be but oh well

" I have anxiety every day that JT might win the next election .Will Sun Life deny me insurance "
"It's a free market, you could always get together with your pot buddies and start your own high risk insurance company. "
everyone is defending the company
Hahaha
lmfao

What the fucking hell?
Aren't we tax payers carrying enough of the ills of society on our backs already without adding more Liberals??
CBC comments are so cancerous
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/ontario-man-says-life-insurance-application-denied-due-to-anxiety-disorder-1.5238719
link?
how are people so shitty
for having mental illness
people in the comments calling him a 'snowflake'
jesus
yeah they're just trying to make money
it just tries to even itself out
so its not-for-profit
maybe insurance should all be done through the government
insurance is bullshit
money hungry fucks
but having anxiety... or conditons in the family
like i makes sense to deny someone on deaths doorstep
What the fuck
what the fuck is the point
I couldnt get life insurance on my bank loan (where it defaults if you die) because a member of my family has cancer
Some guy got denied life insurance because he has generalised anxiety disorder
I hate all insurnace
holllly fuck
I fucking hate life insurance
80% tax for income over $5M or something
okay nice
I'm heading on lunch for like a half hour
Imagine the money that could be spent on services
80% tax would be great
no matter how rich you are
Im pretty sure ours dont go over 33%
Some countries have like an 80% tax bracket lol
Yeah like wtf 500k is still a fine amount
$500,000 is still pretty fucking good
id be happy to pay 50% tax if i made $1M per year
Even though no party is trying to make that happen, the people the poor vote for are trying to do the opposite
wealth redistribution
if any
Poor people shouldn't have to pay much at all
ideally yes
Rich people should pay most of the taxes
lol
That's the only fucked up part about taxes
if you're rich you don't need to
fucking rich people
Also when youre rich just pay your fuckign taxes lol
people dont realise that the government IS the people, that we need it, and we have better lives when it has money lol
people think the government is robbing them or something
if youre poor
And we get all of the tax plus some back at the end of the year
exactly
how the hell else would anything get done lol
So am I
im very pro-tax lol
it's so fucking dumb
blind hate
theres hate for anything with the word tax
gas prices aren't any more expensive than they were a few years back
I hate the hate for the carbon tax too
yes lol
and that's with a carbon tax and everything
i mean the paris targets are allready about to be missed
it wouldnt be
any educated person would realise it's not
yeah.... how would that even be possible
Conservatives just either completely lie or don't even say what they're planning on doing
"Scheer's plan tells you what he won't do: no carbon taxes, no clean fuel standards, and generally nothing that costs anyone anything. What the plan doesn't tell you is how he plans to square all of this with Canada's Paris targets and/or prepare Canada for success in a world acting on climate change."
action is required
but its not enough
The liberals acknowledge climate change which is a a huge step, way better than conservatives
yep
like they do in the states
yep
It's good when people don't just blindly follow their party
yeah
Good on the MP I mean
Year conservative one is disaster
Good on her
Haha damn
He is projected to win this next election under green
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/conservative-party-climate-plan-andrew-leach-1.5240070
when the news was annouced about trans mountain being acquired and approved
The MP for the liberals in Victoria where Annie works literally 'crossed the floor' from the liberals to join the green party
done it
its in the green and NDP platform and other countries have odn eit
theres way to decouple the carbon economy
Ithat's true
you cant be pro-oil and pro-climate action
pipelines
i mean....
Liberals have worst climate change policy other than conservatives
lol
I was like 80% with green, 75% with NDP, 70%ish with liberal, and like 20% with conservative lol
party
I think there was this test last election that tested your compatibility with each part
I heard that liberals actually have the best climate change policy plan
Yeah
Green is better
NDP is good
people underestimate the weight of millions of uneducated peasants votes
Is NDP good or better
Ah true
when they were first nominated
I just think it was like a 95% chance that hilary would win or somethin wasn't it
true
trump was like their Conservatives then
welll
lol
then watch us pull a USA and PPC gets in
Horrible vs bad vs good vs better

And yeah I know lol
it'd be nice if there was a party fighting for con votes
i want another enemy lol
kinda weird logic
yeah, the problem with the conservatives is it's 1v3
which vote splits conservatives
I want bernier to get a seat because it gives his party more momentum
yeah
not so sure about scheer
well at least we know he won't get in at least
fuck
ahh
anti-immigration
anti-environment
Right wing billionair influencers
Nah
that's fox right?
He is friends with the Koch group
Probably
Isn't he friends with white supremecists
to make the PPC
but he defected from conservatives
I see
like he is already in the house
He is the incumbent
ahhh
Its his riding
wait what the hell
33%
who the fuck is voting for him
how does he have 6%
Haha
he will be entertaining in the house of commons
i hope he gets in lol
bernier's riding

yeeee
you can't argue with dumb
Too much to say at once and it all comes out gibberish
I'd have a hard time arguing too
Was definitely a bit flustered
Wish I argued it better
Do chairs cause shootings?
I bet he sat in a chair
yeah...
Does social media cause shootings?
I'm sure he posted stuff to facebook too
it's a very popular platform
for fuck askes
therefore gaming caused it
one guy said that the guy who killed his family in toronto posted pictures to discord which is a gaming platform
Or any other country with video games?
Do they realize we don't have mass shootings?
I told them they arent

Idubbz is just stunned by this guy lmao

He looks like someone from renfrew i swear
Who the shit does he remind me of
Xanned out

'i blacked out and learned something about mysellf"
Is this guy fucked or is it an accent
I'm watching from the point you linked
where i time stamped it

:|
idubbz does a documenatry on "interesting" people
how do i explain this

The tranvestite shanks the anorexic warden that is secretly a lizard person and then Morgan freeman discovers he is a wizard
yes don't spoil as I watch it
DM

Which may be spoilery
yes
Can I ask a question
not anything more than the first 20 minutes of the movie
Do you know anything about it Nick?
Haha I remember I went through all those too
Hahahahaha
that's why I chose to watch it
it's like #1 top movie on imdb
If I remember correctly
Yes
Shawshank is very popular
It is very sad
Know this movie
Wait I think I kinda
Oh wait
american history x was like a good portion prison life

Yes
oh jesus he died
They beat the shit out of him

Yeah have you encountered fat guy yet
It's kind of brutal

It’s a really sad movie
Only like 15 minutes in

this guy has a pet bird in his jacket
It’s about institutionalization
Sorta...
Uhhh

3/3 rush choose 1: coppy minion or become 5/5
Oaisis Smuggler
discover a chose 1
its a common
Like Worth Expedition
if you have spare dust
to craft
I think there are some basic ones
put in "chose 1" cards or
i only have like 5 choose 1 cards
did yoiu
did you uh
if you ahve the quest
vs auto-generated druid
casino mage
rng mage
naw

“And I’ve beeeen inside my wife”
Vince ad libbed lyrics for a song at practise and it ended up being “I’ve beeeeen inside my driver”
Hahaha

naw unfortnetly not
wasn't sure if I wuld get two of the secrets
Then a crd that would replay a spell that I played this turn
I had  secret that I wanted to play
but cant stack the same one
up to 5
you can have several DIFFERENT secrets out at once
damn
no
Can secrets stack <@!257986741896609802>
30-50 mins
before I gotta go
but I only got like 30 mins
I am good to fight fin
anywho
ahhh
I think
basic pack, but it has all golden cards
and a golden pack I think
you get a golden legendary
if you get all the wings
also
in ALL the wings
dont forget the getting a wing gets more classes to play with
hmmmmm
so you could get 13 packs, or you are close to getting 6 packs and 2 wings
if you like deckbuilding roguelikes
you get the singleplayer roguelike stuff
BUT
for coin usage, you get 7 packs for 700 gold, while getting a wing of dalaran gets you 3 packs for 700
Here is the thing
The dalaran heist is like
Well
two wings?
13 packs? lol
whats the best usage of 1300 gold shon
but i think ive just been lucky
im 2-0
its a bad brawl
its literally areana but you make you own deck
wow whats the point
oh its legit the same
arena rewards I think
what are the brawliseum rewards
ello
ayy hey shon
not a fun one 😦
why did i enter this
aw braliseum wtf
value town.
then double the double
you double the amount you get
when you double battle cries
so
most ways to get them are via battlecries
lackies are 1 mana cards (generated by other cards) wuith very strong battlecries
i have a few
and a bit in this expansion
dust*
1600 gold though
they were introduced in rise of shadows
You will want to get lackys
in you get quest shaman quest
oh fin
guess im makinga  druid deck
I'm just doing a quest first
its friggin strong bith battlecrys
but you should try to get shjaman one
thats actualy legit really stong btw
Ah you got druid one
why

I feel like I got a good one
idk what deck you got but
Also
give me a sec to oppen HS
I can test it
Sure
<@!257986741896609802> you free to test out my deck on
Yeah, it needs your whole cpu plus some
Hearthstone running at 136% cpu casually

2k is like imminent explosion though
Mine runs without at 1080
But still going
Fans are lesser now
I put it down to 1080p
Turn down to 1080p and your golden
Yeah if you run hearthstone at 2k it’s fan city
Not going to bother with it in my mage deck
paladin and preist, or some neutral cards heal
I guess you gotta be paladin and do heals
but you can heal him back to full with other cards
he WOULD have amazing stats for his cost
lol yea
lmao this card's battlecry is deal four damage to himself
Just so I know what I have
its not perfect, but its cool
I'm going to use the one that just suggests cards
Oh! That's really cool
It takes hearthstons own statistics and knows what cards added usualy increase the winrate of the other cards in your deck
its not bad actualy
there is one that lets the AI compleate the deck for you
There are several ways
nvm
Do they not help you make  deck anymore
lol heathstone is not optimized
<@!331154975457673228> does it do that to you
and makes the fans go crazy
for some reason hearthstone uses like 80% of my CPU on my macbook
Also jumping into those ball pits you basically just grand slam yourself directly on to the floor
I wish we sold walls
sell walls or something
do they like

Lucky lad
U at the Elgin stret diner Finn ???

When ur at a restaurant and they keep@topping up your coffee and you don’t know how@much you’ve drank
Zerus
Like I would never get rid of shifter zeros
It pains me because I always wonder what will become the next meta
I think I’ve only ever disenchanted like 10 cards
Haha maybe
...or just agro me down
But can you out-value the value mage?
I have a lot of cards
Haha
and might stand a chance against my value mage 😎
but I know you had a fairly good colection fin
if he has a lot of cards or not
idk what nicks deck is like
Lol
thats called standard btw fin
Lol
But would punish FTP players who disenchant everything haha
https://i.imgur.com/uOMpy7n.jpg
There should be a brawl that somehow leans on your WHOLE collection
Oh yeah
There’s always a rare
so if you kept a basic pack, its like, 260 dust
because disenchanting gets you like, 1/4th of a cards worth. Keeping a card means you basicly saved the cost of crafting it, aka 4x as much dust
if you dont disenchant a card, then the pack was worth way more
Yea. Then its worth MORE then that
And sometimes you don’t want to disenchant everything because you want to@be able to play other classes
But sometimes it has cards you want
or 420 if you get a legendary
sometimes its more like 120 dust if you get an epic
but a pack will get you (if you disenchant it all) 60 dust.
Of golden leg in pack
yea
Odds are very low
if you get really lucky, a shity golden legendary is worth 1600
with swings upward of 100-400
each pack is avrage 55 dust I think
40 dust is nothing, its also very easy to get
And that can’t even craft me a leg
almost enough to make a legendary
I have like 1500
they where only worth 40 anyway
Aw haha
naw
equal to the crafting cost
Is 40 a lot?
everyone who owned them got dust fro them
oh 😦
aka basicly removed
a few cards were sent to "hall of fame"
Oh
Just type "New" into your collection and tell me if you see a fancy legendary spell

you should have (probobly) got a free legendary quest. Look through you new cards to see
also
I think
Dust?
I'm down!
I’m getting breakfast now but we should play later
I got 40 blue bottles because of my cards being wild
Lol same
Ahhh
Free To Play
and yea if you happen to have only standard cards you can play standard
And same
What’s FTP mean
Haha
which means I cant keep up with new stuff lol
Have decks for both though
I like wild because I am FTP
Both
Do you think I should choose to play wild or standard
its really fun SP too
The dalaran hiest, the first part is free, and igves you 3 "Rise Of Shadows" packs
ooh
also
but within the first 10 packs there will be 1
it could be the first, it could be the 6th, 10th, etc
will ALWAYS have a legendary
the first 10 packs you open in any expansion
Also a note
Should I
I have 1000 gold
I got saviors of uldum
but in wild everything is avalible
basicly older cards (other then basic/classic) were roateded out so they could release new cards without new cards needing to be blantantly more powerful
lol your old decks are probobly wild only (I play wild)
there are lots of free singleplayer stutff
Should I make a new deck as I can't remember any of my old ones
also
yes
Like legendary quest spell
Launching now
ohh
if you log in now
you get a free quest in hurtstun
yes
Oh nick
😦
So 8
Just checked and she has six here
A lot of characters just die
The latest one whatever number it is
I mean Sad stuff has already happened
Oh! YOu might be right
I think she might have it? I saw she had more
And she doesn't want to read that hahahaha
Because apparently something really sad happens
There's also a 5th book but Brianna hasn't gotten that one
Oh that'd be cool! I think chapters sell them
And nice dude! Same
I wanna get like a box set of saga books
I'm gunna try and get back into hearthstone
Yeah
And my memory is awful
It's been a long time
To read the fourth
I think i'd need to reread the entire series though
I heard from Brianna
Shit gets fucked
4th was great
And then never got back into it
Hahah rip
I got to the third and then stopped reading because Brianna hadn't gotten the 4th yet haha
Both by blizzard I guess
Damn dude you're going through them quickly!
And why is the trailer hearthstone
I finished book 3 and 4
What's Warcraft 3
Sorry Brianna
And aww haha
Lol

K
Also yea it was great last night
K
Making an entire paragraph to get a fuckin' one letter response of the tenth letter in the alphabet, you think that's fuckin' funny, jackass? Do you want your crush to respond back with "k" after you spill your feelings out like this? (Take me back, Emma.) Huh? What if I did it to you? k. Did you fuckin' like that? What, did you just jizz in your pants because someone disregarded your entire effort of writing this ENTIRE paragraph FROM HAND in about fifteen minutes? That just makes me feel fucking rejected just like my ex. (Take me back, Roxanne.) k. What're you, fuckin' gay? Can I have a response that actually MEANS something instead of just shitfacing our "conversation" with the spam of "k?" Now occasionally with questions or something it's reasonable, but doing it to any fucking response they say. "We're having a nuclear crisis, you have fifteen minutes to evacuate." You're the type of person that would fuckin' say "k" to that, you limp dick hypocrite. You think you can get away with this, right? You think it's SOOOOOO funny to do this shit, but I can guarantee that you'll be taken out back and shot soon. You're fucking dead, "k"iddo.
No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about a single letter? I bet you took the time to type that one letter too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing "send". You're so fucking pathetic. I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that. You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee. What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing. I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response. Do you want "K" on your gravestone? Do you want people to remember you as the asshat who one day decided to respond to someone with a single letter? "Hey, look, everybody! It's that "K" guy!" That's who you are. You're going to be known as the "K" guy. How does it feel? Do you feel happy? Quite honestly, I don't care, which is why I'm not even going to respond to you. Goodbye, and good luck with your future as that guy who said "K". Alright listen up motherfucker, and get your comfy seat because we're gonna be here a while. Do you really think you can just get away with "k" as a message? What if someone did that to you, huh? Do you think you would like it?
K? K what? The letter before L? The letter after J? Did you know that in JK the K stands for “kidding?” So your reply is “kidding?” or K as in Potassium? Do you need some Special K for breakfast? K as in I can K/O you? Can I knock you out and feed you to hungry sharks? Sharks have a K in it. "K"? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is "K"? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only letter you can comprehend is "K" - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proof-read by several professors of literature. Don't believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be "K" once again. Do I give a fuck?
oh man yeah it's actually kind of cold inside our apartment now

then Statistics

You just have to convinently forget a step
hehehe
STATISTICS
problem with that is that its country censuses that have a 1% error, and no global census exists
holy shit

https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Frostmourne
saw that lol
statistics
https://i.imgur.com/VlaUdxZ.png
yea there are a lot of guud elementals
you get +8 health and deal with two of their minions
yea its great
that comes out
if youre nearly dead
so you can easily get 2
it saves you late game
its a common
too powerful

yes
i like the new shaman lifestyle rush one
and their elemental based battlecrys
could also work well with elementals
cuz quest shaman doubles all battlecrys
you just get all the options
it becomes 9 mana 6/6 Taunt, Rush, Divine Shield, Windfury
if you play him in battlecry shamana
Fits any situation
very strong dude
7 mana 6/6 battlecry: choose two of the following: Taunt, Rush, Divine Shield, Windfury
Diverse
elemental legendary
siamat
but yea a new neutral legendary
same haha
not anymore
there was a time where i probably knew every card
too many new cards
I cant keep up with the times
3 kinda
there are still 2 legendarys I really want
I could have made the mage element legendary, but decided against it
now theres TOO much synergy
Mage also has a lot of element support
there was just enough synnergy to make it badass
people didnt expect it back when i played it
you have to now choose what ones you want
yeah its sad
there are litteraly too many elements to fit into a single deck
i had literally every elemental possible lol
mine was niche at the time
just disenchant the quest you get and get all the fun new elements lol
theres too many now
you could prob get a bunch of new ones
bc i have all the old elemtals
it ruined my deck
yeah
like one that says: If you played an elemnt last utrn, discover an element
I made it right when elementals became a big thing
There have been a lot of good new elements
lol
Elemental control deck
ELEPHANTS GUIDE ME
do you remember my shaman deck? Elements guide me?
lol
all my cards are wild
becuase
Yea I only play wild
i used to have a shaman deck that was like unbeatable but now its so outdated
The main deck, elemental version, secret version, big spell version, and RNG version.
wow nice
I made like 1 main deck with my cards, and made like 5 versions of it as variants
or warrior
its horrible against rogue
rng
beasts or murlocs
random
its just
yea but
bc they are board flood
if youre against hunter or shaman its good
mage minions dont have a lot of HP
if you have big boys its fine
"Randomly lose borard control"
friggin trash
i have that one lol
f that guy
like flame leviathan
a few shiity legendarys
well
like 2 im missing
got almost 1 coppy of every mage card
disenchanted EVERY non-mage non-neutral card
Haha thats what happend to me
i think if i disenchanted everything from every other class i could afford like every card from one class
becomes: Summon 2 5/5
or another one: a 3/3 that says: Gain +2 +2 or summon a coppy of this minion
it becomes: Summone 2 4/4 trees and give all other minions +2 +2
ah damn 4/4 trees?
another big chose one: Either summone 2/2 trees, or give all minions +2 +2
nice
if its was: Become a 2/2 with charge, or a 2/5 with taunt, it becomes a 2/5 with charge and taunt
ah i see
so like
There is an example of that: For transform cards, it gets the highest stats with all effects
so itd summon both
Oh its usually a summon
y*
once you beat the quest it basicly just says "Deal 4 damage to a minion and draw a card"
8/8 with x and x?
what baout cards that are like "turn into a 3/3 with x or a 5/5 with x
like "Chose 1: Deal 3 damage to a minion, or 1 damage and draw a card"
oh damn
In druid, they have many "Choose 1: do x or y"
you draw 2 choose 1?
choose 1 card from what?
its a passive, no mana cost
Your choose 1 cards now choose both for the rest of the game
Druid quest is good too
and i have 4 druid legendaries
Druid could be fun
cuz I never had any fun with anything but mage
lol
that are not mage
disenchanted all class legendaries and stuff
Yea I actualy went in and like
Golden Lorewalker
I have like a lot of useless legendaries i can scrap
If not you might have enoguh dust to make the shaman one
its also really fucking strong
I hope shaman, cuz you like them
I wanna know what quest you get for free
Guud
and ive got it on my laptop!~
geochemistry, hydro-geology, ecology, and wetland characterisation
make sure you got hurtstun on your phone
when your up in the Frew

Hahaha
the face of mourning. Yee-Awe
<:farq:590992724262387731>

Let's take a minute to mourn our fallen brethren
those poor souls
not everyone survived it
it was just war
there were no rules in middleschool
Just have a casual conversation
lmao
I deadass had a kid come into my stall once and try to talk to me
Hahahaha
That experience scarred me for life
In middle school someone tried to jump into my stall from the neighbouring stall

Ooooof

lol
Just like the water lines going into our washing machine
Hot is cold and cold is hot
It's also installed backwards lol
It's so ridiculously sensitive
Our shower goes from cold to hot if you even tap it with your finger lightly


Cory Chromosetti

Kenya wanted to get onto the wardrobe but the curtains were closed. That didn't stop her
fuck off kids
Both are good games
But fortnite will be as well soon
haha, yea
WHICH IT IS
But now it's a nostalgic classic
A few years ago you were autistic if you played minecraft
lol but like
yes tehy do
People just hate whatever's popular
the internet is quick to judge
I remember a few years ago when everyone said Minecrat players were autistic
It really annoys me how suddenly the internet loves minecraft and calls Fortnite players autistic

Sleeping with women with venereal diseases
Why do you get wings for
Wha
Biker gangs sound fun
There are also wings or biker's wings, which are earned something like jump wings or pilot's wings, but with various color-coded meanings, e.g. in some clubs, it is said that a member who has had sex with a woman with venereal disease can wear green wings.[31][32][33][34]

Oh wow not bad
Hunter you just use that one spell that Gives you a shit load of dogs
replace hero power with 2 mana gain a random sepll, it costs 2 less
Play 6(? maybe 10?) spells
mage one is
hard to compleate
Pls
Oh man aggro
replace hero power with "give your minions +2 attack"
Does faceless count as a battlevry
summon 20 mins
hunter quest is
Crazy
Lol
a hero power
but
think of it like brann
It would be more relatable 2 me
Yes bran
Brann
Oh yea
Lol
It would be better if he was on vine
Hearthstone guy who swings in on a vine
Oh
Not vine
On the vine
I’m talking about a real vine
You said

Rebecca it's not what you think
I won't hesitate bitch
With the gun
On the vine
That guy
That’s like
very strong
Shaman one is: Play 6 battlecry minions.
Reward: Replace your heropower with "2 mana, all battlecrys are doubled this turn"
Noice
gives huge benefit
always starts in hand
that costs 1 mana
Nice

Brianna is always in instagram discover
female garfield
Kenya is definitely a rarity
I think the vet told us that too
Also brianna apparently orange female cats are rare
:lenny-shrug:
So mark is a coke addict now instead of heroin

hahaha
I radiate negativity and give compliments ONLY once a day
yeah they could left that bit out lmao
Everything else has been fairly plausable but that made me laugh
yes lol
the most ridiculus thing
thats like
but yeah it was silly
good so i didnt spoil it
I laughed at that
lmao
I JUST watched that
and
not finished
nice what ep
I am just watching Mexico
I couldnt suspend my disbelief
haha
but yea shows like narcos, mindhunter, or just simple documenterys are great
like when he dropped the grenade into the hole to explode his way into the aquifer
overly dramatised parts
althought certain things in it make me cringe
yeah narcos is gr8
Narcos is really good
where is all based on the real stuff, but its been streched a little for drama
Narcos
like
but where its
Documentaries as re good
idk what its called
like
and
documenterys
i like
Lol American sniper is propaganda
and same
are bad
overly americanised dramas like American Sniper
I like movies with really good dialogue
some soap opera -esque dramas are bad
Yeaah
rom coms are sometimes bad
yeah
Too copy pasted
Same
Superhero movies
And hahaha
Out of curiousity what movies don't you like
'it was too sad to see the boys get addicted to heroin"
Spreading that positivity
and lmao
That's good
i made a rule that ill only write reviews for movies that i liked, and highlight what about them made me like them
"there was too many drugs in the movie" for train spotting
lol
I always write negative reviews
I could do it but Nick wouldn't let me because it would be all negative
Lmao
"And then there was, like, explosions and shit, and then the daughter died! Oh yea he had a daughter btw, anyway, then when the bad guy survived he..."
"it was pretty good". Can you make that into a 600 word essay?
and reviews them based off of your summery
he does not watch them
then you kinda roughly explain the plot
have fin write reviews for movies you watch
lol
Also that poor gazebo never knew what hit him
You need to write reviews for the movies I watch. I'm not articulate enough to review them
Yes you do
damn i need to continue movie blog
it actually lives up to first
gr8 movie
As is to be expected
yes
Trainspotting 2 is off to a nice refreshing depressing start

This meme is too much iq for me!

lol
I hate it so much it just enrages me
That face though

"pls help I need open"
Oh God yea
J had to do customer service that day
*gets a call at 3 am*
"Is it oppen?"
I remember that happening during the tornado last year
lol
Lmao
Ive been in customer service and 95% of the calls are just people asking if the store is open lmao
Haha cool
Sure, 12:30 works, my hair is still drying :p
Hey sorry Shon want to do 12:15 or 12:30 haha
Need more time to get ready? Or is 12 still good?
I just finished my own shower
Haha thas fine
Accidentally woke up later than I wanted
that was a hour and a half and i basically watched all of it
and he watched this bitch tell this story BACK on the tv and shes like the nerve im surprised she doesnt have the *clap* (distortion on the word clap)
this- this motherfucker who pushed her out of her chair is saying the story the EXACT MOTHERFUCKIN SAME AS HER but hes just like yeah i fuckin pushed her lol fucking called the cops on me tried to have me arrested
this is ..... beyond fascinating .... these people in this documentary were living SOME kinda life
she did the Shakespearian speech thing for 40 minutes btw
which she instead of going to the place she was SUPPOSED to be at for 7 she went and got INSANELY drunk instead and then gave them a Shakespearian speech instead of doing her lines which they actually used to make ANOTHER movie
ok not porn just a regular movie she had a part in
now theres an elongated scene from a... ppppooorn?? and its just like a dude fighting and beating up a drag queen...?
i love her
OOOOOFFF called another drag queen that PUSHED her over, a tacky bitch and called the police
Respect for her tons but uuuhhhhh the boyfriend part is...... Hm
She's so actually wild
....... She won awards
documentery
interesting
this sounds like an eh
I- just
I-
oh
What
Oh no... Oh noooo..... She got a biker to fist fuck her ex bf when she found him cheating with a 16 year old girl.....
expecialy when others are not understanding
feel bad for anyone who goes through with anything like that.
I am in LOVE with her
She said to him you get three big men to hold you down and one butt fucks you what do you call that
😦
To her because she's trans right back then she was a man Johnnie her name is sandie now
Oh my god. The judge said a man can't be raped
thats so mean
wow that sucks.
They're asking if she enjoyed it she says no they asked her if she got teared up she said yes it was horrible like this poor person she was in her WHEEL CHAIR WHEN THEY DID IT TO HER she has fucking polio
Someone made a very disrespectful creepy pasta using her movie and there's a scene where this stranger is interviewing her asking her about how she's been raped and the questions are so point blank on not well worded I feel so horrible for her
I'm watching this really odd documentary on this drag queen called the goddess bunny
Ok so uhh

I've been hard since I started playing four hours ago
im hard

I'm already playing her idk how I forgot that
True dude true

bro just play as zelda bro zelda is a girl isn't zelda the main character bro
lol
It's mildly nasty
Because they don't let men in
Playing botw and to get into this one town I have to dress up as a women
Lmao
lookin like i drank flint michigan water right there
christ

yeah i hope i delayed it a bit for now
if you block it on the surface you will stop a lot
yea it does not spread insanily fast
so maybe it'll be sooner than i think
But i've played a lot in the past few days, i just started on thursday
yeah i probably wont be beating plantera for a while
ough that's a lot of work
unless i dig down to hell right
fuckk
wot seriously
once you kill palntera it will slow a lot
it will probobly still spread downaward but yea
and 17% crimson but i closed it off
my world is like 6% hallow lol
true
hollow will stop corruption
if you spread hollow
but
No, it justp ushes it back a lot
yea ur right, does it permanently stop corruption as soon as u spray it
the claminitor or whatever its called can be used to stop corruption
also once you beat the a boss (prob twins) the mechanical chick will show up
Once you beat palntera the spread wont be bad
i think i also properly enclosed the crimson in my world, i forgot i had to do that originally
yeah i needa just focus on mining rn so i can build the forge
lol rip
dont forget to make orichalcum anvil, and titanium forge.
then i got hit with a blood moon and the twins at the same time lmao
yeah ive found a couple deposits but i had to craft a orichalcum pick
titanium is only really found deep underground
frost armor will help a lot, if not that then get titanium. Drink a spulunker potion and go to hell's surface to look for it
why does titanium have to look like all the early game ores lol
im using it exclusively for spelunker potions rn so i can get some titanium
yea i made a greenhouse i just need to start farming shit
maybe farm up on them a little
they do help a lot
use potions
if you need help
and not die all the time
you must master it on your own
maybe if i get frost armor i could finally win
hah
help me just get through normal mode im a fucking pleb
yes
let me know
https://tenor.com/view/fuck-that-koksal-koksalbaba-koksalgif-gif-13281890
and ever want to try calamity
if you beat the moon lord
Anyway
yes
sounds of the inferno
Jesus christ
and it gets lowder each pan
the camra panning from one to the other
as the two of them off-pitch screaming at eachother
I just invision the last image
hahaha
but some sick fuck HAD to put some dentures in it and just terrify those children
yes its so disgustingly beautiful
that plushie was probably there to make kids feel like nervous about seeing the dentist
like somebody put a pair of dentures inside the mouth of a winnie the pooh plushie inside of a like a dentists office
<:winny3:591711351466885149> <:mike3:591711562046111774>

Death.
All or nothing

it is
Death Mode
and finally
Revengeance
Expert
Normal
there are 4 difficultys in calamity
<:mike3:591711562046111774>
<:winny3:591711351466885149>
Let me put it this way
?
like worse than expert mode
palantera is still a massive bitch
to put them onto Calamities scale
ough
of default terraria
the bosses
BUFFS
Calamity
Another thing
Not at all
plantera does not compare one bit
hahahahah christ

DOG
His name?
he is one of the hardest mother fuckers
This one boss
but
hell
as
is hard
the boss after him (the legit final boss)
DONT GET ME WRONG
its the make-or-break point
Probobly the hardest boss is not even the last one
its crazy
its
couldnt even imagine how hard it gets
it adds gameplay past him
an entire new fucking game
with many of them going past the moon lord
jesus christ
Calamity adds 22 NEW bosses
it ends at THE MOON LORD
In terraria there are 15 bosses
calamity
yes
then our fuckin save files got deleted
something like that
we only got past the golem when we played right?
Calamity
Anyway
dont remind me
jesus
this guy -will- fuck up your shit
You thought fighting plantera in the jungle was bad?
hahahaha
is this mother fucker hard
*holy shit*

True
Swear to god theres like no titanium in my world lmao

Frost armor is a great pick
Always ranger 😉
Maybe frost armor cuz I'm going ranged again
are you a ranger, wizard, or melee?
also
Yea better gear helps a lot
it's such a friggin grind
Im in hardmode rn, but haven't beat any of the mechanical bosses yet they're hard as tits. I feel like I just need better gear like I don't even have titanium armor yet lol
bEANz

<@!331154975457673228> Kevin says you are a handsome guy
i think i blocked it from memory because i was so afraid he was going to die
i think theyre crashing but i cant remember what happened
i forgot <@!331154975457673228> ,,, what happened to lying cat again
ac alwaysh elps
it will help
emergency AC
No idea if that will help the humidity but maybe
Windows may need to close and AC might need to go on
Okay emergency protocols may need to be activated
yes
Worth it
I just plug it into any outlet I intend to stay close to for longer then 10 mins
mine is a 15$ one I got last summer
I do not own a fan
but still hot
it is nice
I have a fan on me
Im not sure I can sleep in this
Yeah 😦
😢
but the tempurature goes up
the humidity goes down over the week
It wouldn’t feel cold if dry, but that’s essentially room temperature
Since none of our sweat can evaporated readily
Even though it’s apparently only 20 out which would feel cold if dry, the humidex is 27
we are all suffering
nick needs to turn down the thurmastat already
It’s known as relative humidity because it’s relative to much much a parcel of a given temperature and pressure can hold
So when it cools down it hits 100% faster
Evaporated water I mean
Warmer air can hold more water
floods
Or fog
Rain happens
you hit 100%
Without condensing into a liquid
what happens if
We are at 96% capacity for how much evaporated water can stay in the air at a given time
Noooo
its currently only 4% less water then water outside
if water is 100 % water
And lol no
You can’t really sweat
96% of the air is water
so that means
Yes
it says its 96% humidity
I’m sticky
Lol
nick turned the thurmistat up too high
This is the most discomfort yet I think
it is
I’m swimming
This humidity is unbearable
you gotta help us scoots
it is truly a work of art
Masterpiece
It’s making fun of Cats the movie musical thing

Because it's supposed to be pronounced puh-hrase of course
I’m so mad

It has rules and then doesn't even follow them
English is like the worst language
I hate English

Idk who her mother is tho
She got those from her mother
She's got good vocal chords
I worship her
Something

Kenya is
Whom we must appease
She is a deity
But kenya is not a pet
Not *
Now having pets
I like
She just walks around the apartment complaining that nobody else is awake
And won't stop
She just wakes up and then starts meowing
Nice
I got like three hours of sleep because of Kenya

i wish other people watched devilman because this is very accurate

https://i.imgur.com/PjqtZ1d.png
Played some classic zombies, put up some posters and played tennis terribly
Ah forget about it dude it was a good night besides all that
So you think they're lying?
but it was so obviously them who did it
some random artist who actually seems like a nice guy
:(
and now I just feel like an asshole
but they denied doing in
so I messaged them on instagram saying that that was a shitty thing to do
so I assumed it was them
People will be cunts
But theres was another poster someone put up where it was
I know
Ah don't dude we put a ton up
Snarky bastard
I got irrationally angry about the poster being taken down
He was a huge dick
he put me in an awful mood
He really ruined my night
i really shoudnt have tipped that waiter
Maybe they tried to take it but it got cringled so they gave up
Why not that small one beside it
And why that poster
It's not even fully down
Not sure what the point of that was
Christ what asshole so
Yep
Did someone tear it down on like an hour
Whaaaat

And was like "I'd be able to stand if the driver wasn't driving like a fucking idiot"
He was falling all over the place when he got hp
It really was
That's disgusting
Ugh
Until he got up
Didn't know he was hammered to the point of slurring and just harassing her
I thought he was down syndrome at first and that she was being nice
He was sitting beside her and talking to her the entire time but I wasn't listening
He got off
Ew, can you do anything to help her?
Someone else was like "and ex wife"
While dropping beers all over the place
"there's my future girlfriend"
And calling the bus driver an idiot
Harassing a womej
This dude on the bus is wicked smashed
Because I couldn't understand his accent
I've noticed that before. I once had like a 7 year old explaining what her father meant at customer service before
https://youtu.be/50RuzLTF5Lw
Most of the time they don't even have accents
It's usually the children who speak English better than the parents
It's funny they were french and I think the children were the only ones who spoke English well, I've noticed that alot
C:
Her dad was like :O thank you!!
It was so cute
Hahah that’s sweet
UuU
Then it wont have time to melt
I said make sure you buy it at the end !
Omg the cutest little girl asked me if her family bought ice cream would it melt on the way home
!!!!
You can play tennis in an office

Hahaha I thought you were playing tennis!
Oh
This is where I am

I'm not there haha
You make me jealous!!

But I get yelled at alot more
Lol I mean I do that too
Fin's job is pretty bad
me and fin took an extra hour on lunch to just play chess in a random coffee shop today
but it doesn't matter
mines just annoying
I dont think Nick or my jobs actually matter in any way
I feel like my job stresses me out worse than yours , and yours like.... Actually matters and has stuff that actually is stressful happeningn
Going into work every day his starting to get harder and harder and it was already hARD
God I hope so
Once you finish that off you can sign up for FSWEP and start looking
your professional resume is looking really good
I'm sure you will
You'll definitely find something soon Brianna
Same with another one of my friends actually
Only leaving restaurant work at 28 years old
My friend worked minimum wage until he was like 25 and then went into CS and is now working in an office
it's not telling of anything
I only just left retail like 2 months ago
But we're trying
Fact that I haven't left yet is pretty tELLING
Haha we like to think so
Youre too smart to be in retail anyways brianna
networking jobs have already basically been automated
So will data entry
Excited for the day I get layed off from my dead end job
Haha thx Finn
lol
I always thought the Truman Show was an actual show
retail will all be automated soon enough
Literally all 1998/99 movies: Fight Club, American Beauty, Truman Show, The Matrix, Office Space, Being John Malkovich
It's the most dead end, end you can get
That nobody should have to endure
Retail is just a crime against humanity
What if you took those people and put them in retail
I can't wait to work in the basement of a random old house
boring blue cubicle office
I'm definitely seeing it in my office
Yeah
Because there was nothing eventful happening in peoples dead end office jobs, and its about breaking free of that
American Beauty
Because all offices were painfully drab?
Fight Club, Office Space, The Truman Show, The Matrix
oooh
they call is cubicle dystopia or something
Fight Club
all being about complaining about the relative stability of the time
about movies in the late 90s
Also just watched a cool eye openeing movie thing
wow


Property, robbery and assault offenders are more likely to commit a crime again on release
sexual, homicide and drug offenders are less like to reoffend as well
apparently women's recidivism rates are lower than men's
South east asians are the least likely to commit another offense

according to this random pdf I got sent at work first nations are the highest reoffenders for crimes

lmao really?
I'd totally purposely fuck up all kinds of slang to annoy people
Nathan is literally a child in how annoyed he gets
yes
Like I'm getting to a point where i'd totally do that
I'm pretty sure at a certain age you just like being cringey to annoy kids
https://tenor.com/view/salty-heath-ledger-the-dark-knight-dark-knight-why-so-salty-gif-6124623
true
Minus the unhappy face
ahh yeah that makes sense
haha no upset in a mad way
Or maybe I would
I'd never be like "I'm so salty right now :("
yeah exactly
like "lol youre mad"
it's just the word salty is never used outside of calling out someone for being mad
but being like upset works i guess
usually from losing at something
salty is more grumpy
yeah they are all slightly off
the article is definitely a good example of cringey
Cringey is accurate
what
"Lit: when something is lit up"
"when somebody is being nasty"
they got salty wrong
is it?
Yeet isn't out

when has thriving ever been slang
Oh nooo
oh no
This is fucking disgusting
https://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/im-a-mom-and-im-ready-to-spill-the-tea-on-kids

no change in expression
no hesitation at all

oh damn yeah
I love how fast he said he wants to apologise
it's not great on PS4 because one game takes up the entire HDD
i always do
dunno why I did that
ah yeah
I wish I could lend you the PS4 version but I bought it online
oh nice
And you have to
Yeah i've bought it for both PS4 and PC
I havent been playing RDR2 at all

Driving is nearly impossible though haaha

Hey dad,

Wont have time to write resume until coming back Saturday night after work. Was wondering if you could find the "Resume" or "Resume copy" file on my computer and email it to me so I could fix it up sooner than Saturday night. This would greatly increase my chances to get out of the mcdonalds hellhole and get the new job
I just doubel clicked and downloaded from inside the popup
how do I do that
you can override that

It was dark, the poplar leaves rustled and fell in the cool dank breeze. Fall was approaching and Sobrius was not happy.  He rubbed his brown hands together and shuddered in the wind. "Oh come on Sobby!", yelled Ackely, "Get up and help with the fire if your so cold!". Sobrius turned his head and muttered an insult in the ancient tongue. Sobrius was a Caldarian and was used to the temperate climate of the Caldarian Isles. Caldarians have been described as queer folk by humans. They are withdrawn people and they don't trust many, especially if they aren't Caldarian. They often still speak in the 'ancient tongue' as humans call it, "The language before all languages". Ackley dropped a pile of branches into the pit Sobrius had dug earlier.
just a chunk of text
It has no context associated

If I can get the server files lol
I can do the port forwarding
Yeah it does
It must be possible, seems like a very multiplayer mod
Oh like port forwarding?
Or mention of a server
I can't even find a download for a server
Just trying to figure out the server
the client one is easy I think
Is there a client
Modding
Nodding

Haha I have 4 slots now
Yep
Ooh yeah then definitely
And it’s the easiest thing to upgrade
Yeah but I mean your main computer is less but better

The ddr4 should handle fine
Oh yeah it can handle chickens
computer
I wish I could put it in my new cpu
That can handle chickens

Yeah for real

The same thing is gonna happen to Fortnite in a few years I bet. It's actually a good game without all the 12 year olds

My neighbours could see him and he wasn't even drunk yet
In broad daylight
Were u there when he ran around Nick's neighborhood naked
Okay
Hahaha
It's nothing at all haha
Like Sawyer has literally gotten nude .. multiple times
Like seriously seriously that was nothing but funny
And okay
Oh yeah I think you’re right
Maybe it's backwards
Asian elephants are more docile... I think
Also I'm pretty sure it's African elephants that are very agressive
Yeah the fly was nothing
And the fly this was funny don't even feel bad about that
Oh fuck over what?
Oh no about what
I’m the worst
Yes we had two hour argument #
Nate?
I neeed to stoppppp
I argued with my roommate the other day too lol
I argue too much
Always checking fly and never arguing with people@again
Why
African elephant maybe? And oh no one
Self esteem at an all time low
A specific one is very agressive
I’m stressed
Are elephants aggressive?
The memory of an elephant and the rage of an elephant
Blessing and curse
That's a terrifying image
Lmao the memory of an elephant
I'm like a very angry elephant

Hopeless PS4 resurrection

Lmao
Well

LCBO is like my oasis on my walk home. My short break from unbearable heat
This traffic light post was made in. Renfrew

Hahahahahaha
😠

nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooo
Lmao
DID YOU CALL ME A POOPOO HEAD
FINN
Anytime
thanks for the spam

wontonwaddles@gmail.com
Add me!
We aren't!
Lmao
its because we arent friends on google i bet
awwww
Mmmmmmmnnnno
anything for later today?
hahah
Over and over and over and over
lmao
I saw give Nick 100 dollars
is there anything in yours?
what do you see
Hahaha
Did u do it?
He added DnD and tennis to mine without realising because he added me as an attendee
:O
Me and fin found out you can just add things to other people's calendars with their email
Wait Nick what was your joke
So it's so humid
that will be me
Lmao

They end up giving it to you in Sept ember
but we never got any
I thought they were
idk
they uh
Weren't they giving you AC this year shon
not sure how efficient that would be
and keep freezer open
you should hook freezer fan up to a hose that goes out the window
lmao
yep. wouldnt change it
I could do ALL of this crazy shit because I dont pay for any of it
so if you like made a tesla coil and had like 100 AC's the bill wouldnt go up?
wow
hahahah nice
its included in the bill
I dont pay for power
well
its not the maintaining that costs extra power, its cooling stuff down for the first time
if you do it every night
the ice block method might also be heavy on the power............
Also home time
Hahaha
would probably be more expensive than just buying an air conditioner
lol
probably super power hungry though
throw ice cubes into a fan
also technically you could turn your freezer into an air conditioner if you hooked up a hose to the outside to pump the hot air out lmao
I feel lied too
my apartment feels hotter
rip joke
ruined
ahh this is ruining the joke
and you have that linked to your phone?
wontonwaddles@gmail.com is your email right
aw
lmfao
oh! noppp
brb gotta do this
oh no
it will cool my place down 😄
>:) yes
oven*
into an over
if I put ice
BUT
it heats my house up
into a freezer
warm water
so if I put
I mean on your phone calendar
Ah I get it
<@!136253782131474432> work haha
modify your fridge to be reversed
just
shon
fridge is an inside out air conditioner
same goes for fridge and freezer
if you somehow had a vent to pump the output outside it wouldnt be a problem
lmfao
also its like what we were talking about before, where tyler had air conditioner inside lol
hahah
<@!296572507241054209> is there anything on your calendar for today
mood
hahah
only the ptsd makes it hard to sleep
but it could arguably make your nights hotter
if you dont have trouble sleeping then youre good
only because of the timing
is it making my suffering on this eternal helscape of heat even worse
yep
or
is me freezing at night and pulling ice out durning day helping my situation
so wait fin
it helps to sorta think of cold as just the abscence of heat
but you need to get that ice from somewhere
and yes ice would make the fridge colder, and work less hard
not keeping it cold
its the making the food cold part that releases the heat
I see
ahh
it assumes the food is already cold
yeah so that questions link was copletely different question
would the frozen water make the fridge colder
what if I froze the freezer?
what if you filled the fridge with frozen water
uh
I put frozen water in the fridge to freeze?
what if
what if i put the water in the fridge then in the freezer
heat that has to go somewhere
cold water has more heat in it than frozen water
cold water in the freezer
I'd assume power usage would correlate with heat output though
what if u put
well not really, its about energy consumption, not heat output, and its also assuming the food has equalised temperautre already
Contents vs power usage
But same kind of deal
yeah nick thats a different question
only until it balances
but if you ADD stuff it does
the full refrigerator doesnt take anymore heat
but I have the freezsing happen when I am auto-venting heat from apartment (at night) and then pulling ice out during day (when I cant autovent) I am basicly storing cold for latter.
it's for a fridge but same deal
I didn't read it enough to say what the answer is lol
the answer is in there somewhere
I just googled this
https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/61445/does-an-empty-refrigerator-require-more-power-to-stay-cold-than-a-full-one
heat and cold cannot be created, only transferred
second law of thermodynamics
into your apartment
a lot of heat that the freezer has to remove
latent heat, it releases a lot of heat
so it needs to work harder to cool it
it doesnt, the water warms up the air
freeze
when the door cannot be open
doesnt it just
how does the freezer know the water is in there
lmao the door
and I pull the ice out during the day
wait
ah nice
so the apartment cools
when the door is open
I freeze the water at night
yeah but it works harder when theres water in there
also
I cant turn it off
right but it uses more energy to freeze water, thus heatin gyour unit more
its always on
it's not like he turns it on
well, the freezer's gunna freeze eitherway
and then you take it out and balance it out again
the freezer just heats up your unit
that
wait wait
efficency.
I put giant blocks of water in the freezer to turn into ice then I put them on my desk infront of my fan to cool off from this heat.
When they melt I drink them as water for the day.
I'd literally go buy myself another
just gone
nice full large ice cap
if i dropped an entire iced capp
kill myself right there
i think id just
Me too tho

im a murderer in cold blood first degree i did it i fucking did it
also also
also rn lets do it
hahahahahaha yes
So when are we installing Ancient Warfare MC
omg is it old javier
Nice poster!
oh wow
Like that's actually pretty impressive looking

Wrong picture HAH
Ok so like I was doing it and I found a picture I had of Javier from rdr2 and it's actually very impressive
I faceapped shaggy
So gonqs getting a rec center

I feel like these will get taken because they look so cool
One down

Hahaha
yes
Was it actually inspired by lanky
Lankys cranky get ready for a spanky
Lankys gunna give you a Spanky
inspired by lanky kong
this was Lanky
Jesus Christ
Hahaha
he moved up near the guard under the table and he had his arms extend under the guard, then behind the guard, all the way up to his head, and grab either side of his head. He then said "Kowabunga" from under the table and snaped the guards neck.
anyway
he folds them up when not in use
Shon pls
But his arms alone were 10 feet long
it was like a kitchen table, decently big
But
He hid before the guard entered the room
How big was the table
How did he fit under the table
How did he
he went under the guard, near him
a guard was sitting at it
he was hiding under a table
there was one particular moment
he was a rogue
with this lanky character
It's horrific
Also
bad
This is what it looks lile

dark is best
why not dark
ew
Oh
It's in the settings
It's like blindingly white
whats the light discord theme
Ew this person on the bus is using the light discord theme
Ah right
aka only a few sessions long
it was like a short one-shot esk thing
What campaign was this on
Hahaha what the hell
To add to it the player said Lanky was never not smiling
Christ
reaching over both of you
thats an example
could stand at your feet and touch brianas head
this character, lanky
briana lay down infront of you, with her feet touching your head
and like
if you lay down
like
but yea
Lmao
poeople just ran up to him
Like that would be the least graceful game of d&D ever
he was not invicible because
basicly yea
This just seems like the nuclear option of characters
Did he just destroy and take whatever he wanted
How did he communicate with quest givers
That's insane so was he invincible
visualise how far 10 ft. is away from you
Lmao
and slap them
and you reach out
imagin if somone was 10 ft. away from you
so like
but bugbears can hit things 10 ft. away from them
That's like putting all your stats into strength
yes
Villagers would probably try and kill you
Ahh hahaha
Can you be an orc?
You can, but most people will look poorly at you. Expecily bugbear
You can do that?
you could shank somone 10 ft. away from you
Wait he can use a monsters race as a character?
like
but even still bugbear as a race is fucking gross
it was a mixture of Bugbear + Halbred
haha
Can I say my arms are that lonf
How did he have arms that long
Haha fucking hell how
were 15 ft of reach
his arms
like
I love that
he could hit cratures 15 ft away from him
in a campagin setting
I had a player make a character that was basicly lanky kong

Oh fuck I hate it
Didn't mean for that first screen
Ew
He is
And yes
Like dood u line younger girls fuck an 18 year old
It's literally still an adult man manipulating a teenager who is legally underage and it's gross and because he's a fucked up idiot it's a legal thing
Complete sidenote but is lanky Kong an actual character
'love'
exactly
He used their love of him to get things
And he knows that so like dude is mad fucked
18 is literally only an age because its the cutoff for being allowed to do porn and stuff
It was probably a fan of his and he used that
But 17 there is
And I would still say that's creepy but there's nothing the law can do at that point
theres no cutoff at 18
exactly
There's still the chance for a ton of manipulation and it's creepy as hell
For sure yeah
not age
its all about the power dynamic
Yeah no
is what im saying
Like mentally you'd be very different
no theres no law there
I would say it's still odd
Legally
yet 18 and 30 is fine
Like very bad
17 and 30 is pretty bad
20 and 30 is odder
Like if your 24 with a 17 year old it's bad but it's worse if your 34
25 year old + 35 isn't bad
Yeah
But
its the position of power thatr makes it bad
Basically the older the two people are the less creepy large age gaps gets
Plus the level of mental maturity there
but also 16 is the age of consent most places
well yeah
4 years I think
Rule that allows some cusioning
Like
Because there's that line
I mean it does
30s or 20s doesnt make a difference
That one is also still very much alleged
Pretty bad when your in your 30s
But still bad
It's not as bad as 13 I mean
That's.....
But still bad
Only 17 which isn't terrible
How minor are these minors in comparison to their ages
Well I wanted to know cuz like
still bad
Sjin allegedly sent sexual messages and requests to a 17 yo
age doesnt make a difference though
Probably a range
Ughhhhh
fans idk
30s
These two youtubeers are like 30w
How old are they
Ahh yeah I figured it probably would be , damn though that's gross
its all confidential in the HR investigation
Turps sent sexual messages to fans
Caff like potentially coaxed people into like sending nudes and stuff
Caff's was -worse- if you can say that
Did we see the proof or is this like court level stuff
Sjin is allegations
Well the Caff and Turps are confirmed
Or are these just allegations right now
Confirmed
Is it like
sure
CAnt really watch cus no headphones and I'm on the bus but I'll check it out at home
but the lewis clip is good
well sorry with simon between
this starts with Sjin and then goes to lewis
https://youtu.be/Id6TYQ_5Du4?t=589
yeah he has
Yeah
or rather evryone that there is reason to
so while they have the 3rd party they are invistigating everyone
Lewis has always seemed like a really good guy
yep
Caff's were recent, Turps like in the last year, and Sjin's was some iffy claims from two or three years back
I guess because of the HR investigation? Good on Lewis for trying to get it all out right away
they are independent events that are all ocming out at once
So Turps, Caff, Sjin
Also why is there so many people involved
yeah its pretty easy to abuse power
It's really sad
It's insane how many high profile people do shady stuff
Yeah
Thats about Caff from Jul 5 or whataver
Here's turps official statement
yep
Hi all,

Just to make a brief statement on this:

Earlier today I was notified of serious allegations made against Caff and his conduct with particular members of his audience. As you know, the Yogscast expects the highest levels of professionalism from its talent and that it is central to the company and its ethos that our fans and community are considered first.   
Having reviewed the evidence and carefully considered this situation, we have concluded that Caff's conduct is a material breach of our talent agreements and code of conduct that results in us terminating his relationship with the Yogscast effective immediately.

We have removed his channels from our YouTube CMS and have requested Twitch remove his channels from association with the Yogscast. He is no longer part of the Yogscast collective.
:(
man it sucks
This kind of thing is happening so much with content creators lately it's insane
Yeah nvm idk why for a second I thought he was taking over
"- we’re looking into some historical claims against Sjin and I’ve asked him to step away from main channel streams in the meantime. "
I'm kind of confused tbh
Or there are claims against Sjin?
Sorry I misunderstood that all
Sjin is just taking back over
It wasn't sjin
Wajt
What ait
First link

whered you see that
And it was with minors too apparently
Fucking hell
i wonder what messages turps sent
and a kid
he also has a wife
Well turps has never had a huge role in videos but he certainly was a personality, and one youd never expect to do that
Fucking hell man I can't imagine how much it would suck to hear this news then
ive watched them for 7 years
i still watch them weekly by the way
cant beleive it
oh my god
Comment by lewis

Sjin is like the very last person youd ever expect to be involved in something like that
and he sucks so thats okay
Historical claims are being investigated against him
There was something about Caff
thats impossible
nooooooo
nooo
There was something about sjin too I thinn
and Tom and Ben
and Duncan and Sjin and Sips
Yes they're good
Except Simon and Lewis
Nobody is a decent person

Guys help
right
ah
Its only when you play it, it wont combine at later points
like if somethign dies in the middle
thought you had to place
right but i had no idea if a mech just happened to becoe to the left it did it too
Only mechs
does it always combine with whatevers to the left?
and basicly gives it charge
it becomes +6/+9 to that minion
combine with it
3 deathrattles
and if you have a mech on the board that survived a turn
or all 3 seperate
you can also combine 2 and put 1 to the side
yep
oh geez if you get it when you have 9 mana you can combine 3 of them
or keep cuz its good
You could disenchant for a legendary of your choice

Oh no — pwned!
This password has been seen 3,730,471 times before
This password has previously appeared in a data breach and should never be used. If you've ever used it anywhere before, change it!
And yeah that's annoying. I signed up and never used it years and years ago
I like how you almost know my password though haha

But probably like Shon said
See if it's safe to use still
Check this site with your password

What's up with Renfrew having a bunch of geniuses
Austin Pierce was like the president of the queens student association or whatever
https://media.tenor.com/images/a26f3178670ecafc6cc49bf38f7472ea/tenor.gif
*Old town road plays*
Hahaha fuck

Communications
Communicatons
Oh no way, doing what?
ye
Eye doctor
Ahh that sounds like a field with good money
Dane works for the Canadian Space Agency
Optometry is focus on like glasses, opthamology is when the eye needs surgery
Optometry* different than Opthamology
Hahaha
D-Barbs!
D-What?
I forgot about him too
for Civil Eng
DBarbs is at uOttawa
Ahhh
Finished general science degree at queens, then I think he is in his one year Eye Doctor course thing
Opthamology
Wonder what Josh is up to now
Hahaha
I remember that I wouldn't have been able to get a single question if I took it so I didn't
I remember Josh Barnes being mad
not on purpose
lmfao
That's awesome dude
and got the best result in the school and got a medal
Ahhh
but i guessed a lot anyways
it was one of those competitions where if you get an answer wrong it penalises you so it discourages guessing
Hahaha
accidentally i bet though
lmfao
i beat him in the math quiz
That's fucking insane
he is also like a year or two younger than us
he is a literal genius
What the hell how is he doing so well
yeah he also worked for Tesla
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4X1JfX6_Q
Holy shit, hets doing so good!!!
Wtf he's in San Francisco
go het!!!!
8O
And IBM
I LOVE HET
He also worked for SMART the company that made smart boards
AHHHHH!!!!!
Yes
H E T
HET
From highschool?!?!?
Het????
!!!!!
How the fuck
What the fuck het shah is a systems software engineer at NVIDIA
It's a legal thing
But just talking about it he's perfectly allowed to do that
It's also very against our contract
Yes it would be
Your not supposed to go into work under influence
Thhhaaaaaats illegal
Also hannad was talking about getting high before work
Well tell them 2 chill and smoke a doob
Apparently there's a lot of prudish people who work here
The government made it legal>>
And the director doesn't like weed
And it was right outside the directors office
The coworker also smokes but this is the government
HAHA why? I talk about weed at work
Coworker told hannad to stop talking about weed at work
I did not like that
that last one is great
disgusting
https://youtu.be/2gxkF_h2LKE
Oh yeah that's the stuff
Wow! I don't like that!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diEm7JIhplk
I love that cat
AHH an oldie but a goodie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUITdxEa1kE
Or a silent meh
Sometimes even a very tiny meh
And her petting meow is simply "MEH"
In verying levels of intensity
'MYEH!"
Myeh
That's her food meow
there is no "ow" sound
MYEH!
thats legit her meows
MEEEEEEEEEEEEEH
Hahaha
"MEHH"
"MYEAH"
kenya would be more like
We can't be sure
Is that guilty or not guilty
"how do you plead?"
"mrow"
Pleads for her innocence
Kenya goes to court
8O
because they are true evil if the are a catburglr
i imagin this person frames kenya as the murderer
Because kenya is gone
Then Nick would be unconsolable
stealing a kat after murdering the owner
thats the worst
Cuz I bet they would
And they stole kenya!!!!
"awe geeze what a mess"
Then u came home and I was all dead all over everywhere
What if he murdered me
Probably, I still don't do it
It was probably our neighbour
i could go for snakcs
mhm snakcs
lol
But I answer that because I'm willing to die for a snack
Even Uber eats scares the shit out of me
And I watched a documentary when I was really young about him and since then I've never answered doors when I'm alone
That was a huge thing that this one serial killer used to do
jeez
😃
Everytime
I'm always afraid of someone over powering me and pushing me back into the house then murdering me
id worry about what it was for
itd stress me out too much not to
huh
No tho haha if I'm home alone I don't answer the door
lol
I hope so
they were trying to tell you to get out because the house is on fire
I did not answer because it scares me to answer the door when I'm alone also I am in my pajamas
I was sleeping on the couch so it was like banging pots and pans together
And scared the fucking living shit out of me
Someone knocked very hard and loud on our door while I was sleeping
lol
Almost too ambitious
Very ambitious in a way similar to Kurt haha
He's a good guy
Oh he's a friend of me and Exequiel
Who is Morty K
lol
It's kind of difficult
All coding
I did the CSS one but failed the other ones lol

also you can take skill quizzes
lol
I have 10 and linked in won't stop yelling me to make mpre
Thats how I have 73
Hahaha
i shamelessly sent out requests to everyone ive ever said hi to
yep
Should I connect with my boss
Doesnt matter what tense you use, all that matter is consistency
Oh thanks man!
Linkedin looks good dude
Hahaha damn dude
you see what i tested?
I hid the scrollbar
Haha
Thanks!
it just scrolls
you coded your chat well
At least it's not an awful lot
Its shitty
Ah weird
didnt think i used that much
somehow
Mine are about that too
thats sweet
Student loans are $15k
My car was $9k and it's almost paid off
noice
It's not much more than my car was
Nah
but that wouldnt even tak elong
I guess a decent chunk would go towards paying back loan
All my financial stress right now is knowing I have to go back to minimum wage soon
I'd have no financial stress
I'm so excited for ot
Oh man I know
Being able to buy a 4k TV sustainably every paycheque
Imagine having this income for like a full year man
Thats perfect
Every department is super in need of people
Yeah thats sweet
I'd feel a bit bad for leaving the department
My bosses are chill as hell luckily
I've got two weeks to think about it now
That's a good idea
and then i understand more of how to communicate the situation
with like what id say
What helps me is drafting a fake email with noone in the subject line
Yeah
But idk how they'll feel about offering me the permanent position if I obviously want to move
You gotta be clear with them about your expectations
It *should* still be there
Like Hannad's thing
Yeah
Like the option remains there
Nah you need it to be set up so that the  confirmed one stays
Basically I'd be throwing away a confirmed position for a potential one
Since its something you like
Dude yeah you gotta get your foot in the door with programming though
So it's a bit of a gamble but if I can get on there I should be set
wow
They offered hannad the option to come back full time anytime on the next 5 years
The other team is apparently desperate for students too
Legit tell him everything about your situation
Yeah that's my thoughts
I advocate clear and upfront honesty
Hmm damn thats definitely a concern to bring up with him
Worried about losing my conditional offer if I try and move departments in my last month of my contract
He said we can figure something out when he gets back from vacation
Boss asked me if I'd rather be programming over what I'm doing now and I said I definitely prefer programming but I also like what I'm doing
Asked about programming today
Just got our
Ok we're on Laurier now
I’m near Elgin
Ok leaving now
Haha
I’m walking now
I think ive gotten lazier as my degree has progressed

lol
Dan reminds me of Savant haha
I remember Savant
Poor tomatto
Lol
He might just be really into his bit for his music similar to the artist Savant but if it's not it almost seems schizophrenic
He sacrificed a tomato

I thought he was on vacation
Also I've never been so disappointed to see my boss
Who's replacing him?
Shit that's lucky man
Lmao

"Uh oh"
So my boss just told me 'we need to talk' and took my into a board room just the two of us, and I was terrified lmao

It would be so pointless for me to move there lol
We could smash down the middle wall and add a door
8O
*I move in*
It's an exact mirror of ours >>>>>>>>>>
Like in the same building >>>>>
Hey Finn there's an apartment getting renovated next to us >>

Enjoy your session
yea haha
No worries though
I forgot you had that weekends
Oh right!
but I would otherwise
I got dnd in a few hours, so I have to pass
@everyone
Any of you guys want to play some switch or some games today
yeah
That explains the intro
Oh shit
Ooooh
mirror images
what sides things are on
like i just mean like symmetry
Like the sides of the screen?
theres some weird shit going on with it
Pay attention to Left and Right
Haha what is it
:
okay this isnt spoiling anything
Its just something i noticed
i want to tell you a secret but I dont know if i should
hahah 100% yes
It seems like the show is one you would have to rewatch to get everything
ive only seen the first 4 episodes
Im hoping it stays good
pay attention to details, it randomly pays off, which is sorta fun
man theres so many little scenes that are confusing but actually have little secrets in them
Good show so far thoigg
yeah haha same
But man I was confused at first
It made a lot more sense by the end of the episode
The one kid used to be dating the girl, who is the sister of that guy, who is the son of the cop dude, who is secretly screwing the original kids mom
Haha
Also you soon realise every character is like connected lol
what are u guys talkin about 😮
Shit starts to go down
It’s kinda like unravelling the mystery
But if you pay attention super closely every single scene is important in Dark
Subs are good though
But yeah the dub sucks
Sorry it may not have been the best suggestion for like easy watching
It’s really a show you have to focus on
Also there’s so many characters.....
I found it hard to follow at first though too
The little things actually matter
I totally know what you mean
Hahah
I feel like every scene is unrelated to the last in the first episode
<@331154975457673228> does this show start to like make somewhat sense soon
There's like a million different things going on in this show
If you can get past the german
But it's pretty good so far
Watching it in German with subs
Yeah it's really notivible lol
How noticable is the English dub over? Isn't that show German
Watching the show Dark
lol
And every other damn enemy in this campaign

😠
oh no

And now she's eating again
And then threw it all up
And then , she inhaled the new food we gave her
Cuz she ate all her food
We fed Kenya when we got home
Well
I love that for her
To cut down on vet fees
She became a vet tech herself
Very nice
I love this
Yeah!!!
and they are up for adoption
$1.6M per year in fees
looks like she is looking aftr them though
ohno
https://youtu.be/MLhesmKn4Cs
Nah I wanted to run in and see Kenya haha
did you not go?
We got home a little late
5:30
its now
Oh
I think it was at five >>
whens concert
you guys might get storm at 9:20pm actually
Because definitely not every cat can't get food because they'res SO many
They're so much competition for food in those situations
tru
Not enough food to go around
pee
poop
babys
aids
unneutered ones
fleas
diseez
where tehrs disees
I see
But really they're making their life much worse by bringing them into this type of situation
Usually what happens is these people trap them and bring them home because they think its helping them to get them off the street
someone hoarded 300
Typically
Because they think they're saving them
they grow
They take them off the streets
and then
or are a few of them not fixed
No
I saw that actually
Is the person adopting 300 cats
In the situation with 300 cats
its literally me with the chickens
So like
https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/more-than-300-cats-found-in-single-toronto-apartment-1.4409251
they rescued 300 cats from a single bedroom apartment in toronto recently
https://tenor.com/view/cat-lady-crazy-cat-lady-gif-6045282
Crazy cat lady
I am
fair
ahhh yeah
And I wasn't doing 2 well cuz of it
Like brought her to Ottawa
I actually got her specifically because I was alone mostly all day
garfeild
wow hard to imagine back when she was at your parents!
https://tenor.com/view/cats-animal-garfield-fat-stuck-gif-3440842
Couldn't even sleep!!!!!!! Went to bed at 7 am
😢😢😢
I missed her terribly
That was very difficult tho
heheh nice
Well I pet her a few times and now she's meowing
Even when you pet her?
She is ignoring me and has not meowed to me once
how can you tell?
why?
Kenya is mad at me
Also
Awww

:O
<@331154975457673228> !! Your not coming today!
and yeah looks like you are going to need new plastic coverings
RAVE PARTAY
We may go like in a few minutes
<@331154975457673228>
:)
oh no
If you can't fix it get rid of it


Might be good for fae wilds
The lights dance around
Also sounds good
Do I have no idea if this will set the right mood for D&D but it's going to definitely turn the basement into a rave

I’ll talk to my dad one sec
Not sure lol, I’ve got too many factors to consider.
What time is best for you?
When would you be leaving <@!136253782131474432>
5 oclock
Mooney’s bay <@!136253782131474432>

this poor cat has been deprived of playing for 18 years because we thought she didnt like it
and then tonight i was like thats not possible cats generally will play its just a thing..... and.............. she plays like a normal cat, and i feel so bad
because all my life my fam was like sasha doesnt like to play
i played with her for the first time like,,, ever
my phone died trying to write this
my cat sasha who is 18 YEARS OLD BTW
oh my god i feel so terrible
yeah for sure
Sure mate
could i get back to you on that in the morning? ill be up early enough to tell you if im down or not
Hmmmm <@136253782131474432>
ill have to ask my dad and sister to see if i have other optioons
hmmm when were you thinking?
Anyway tho Finn what time would you be able to come home with us tomorrow? What time would you like?
Hahahaha
haha thats a cool way of putting it!
Mobius argument strip
unstoppable force meets immovable object
haha we both do that so its a funny combo
😉😉😉😉😉
Didn't mean to put that winky lad in there
I'm fine to argue on most any other topics and frankly I'm usually the one that continues to egg arguments on 😂
Hahaha no tho it's all good
Noted!
Doesn't hit the brain very well 😒
I think tho the topic of abuse like as a philosophical discussion/argument may have to be off the table for me in the future
dont let anyone ever tell you otherwise
if you see it as abuse then that makes it abuse for you 100%!
Unfortunately as much as I'd like to pretend it's stupid dumb shit i apparently have triggers :[
ahhhh well thats not true dont worry about that!
I think it's because the fact that I instantly hear this could not be abuse and instantly hear in my head what happened to you could not be abuse and I immediately have to say no abuse is abuse and it obstructs my ability to properly argue it
well my apologies for egging on
thats crazy
It makes me legitimately upset to talk about :/ which truthfully I wasn't aware of
and lmao nick
quite the F U N topic
My window is soaked in male weed pollen
<@331154975457673228> it's okay Finn if it wasn't a subject that I was so emotionally driven by I think it would have gone a lot better, unfortunately I think the topic is a bit of a ........ #t r i g g e r

We're not but I'll message her
also, nick if you could pass that message onto brianna above somehow maybe if youre still together
Yeah his are doing super nicely
matt has a worse lamp but better windows
Definitely not

basement doesnt hel

I don't think my lamp is good enough
But I've learned it's just that indoor weed is hard
None of my plants are doing ok
hahah
ohhhh
That's the one inside lol
hows the one you planted?
It barely looks remotely like a weed plant
It's so nasty
and lmao the indoor one is hilarious
also <@!296572507241054209> sorry for being a world class aggrevator/instigator, we are pretty much on the same page with 99% of what we were talking about too lol, we just got off on a confrontational start and i egged it on

But outside ones are doing fantastic
oh nice lmao
Killing it now
It's the fucked one that I'm keeping inside
That last one yeah lmao

I can buss separately
Oh no worries
I need to run an errand before we bus over I hope that’s okay
Yes I am!
Y’all excited for DnD ?
Fix and sell
You could save like $200 by fixing it
Lol
Ah, I've already grieved
If it’s the MOBO you’re fucked though
Yeah so normally it’s only the suppressor that is damaged
No way
Apparently most TVs have a surge suppressor that you can remove and rewire around it
I'd pay Matt if he could fix it
Oh no way I would love it if it was
It's in my trunk
Yes
Matt thinks it’s easily repairable
Nick did you keep the old tv
:)
Lesbian dogs
I fi allg got this book I wanteddds

That's good that the owners are trying to fix it though
yes lol
That family has probably been there for like 35 years
so they are ontop of it
the property owners spent $700 on our aprtment on a contract to eliminate them though
That really sucks though
this is the first we have seen of them, but yeah they probably came from the walls

But yeah rip driving down there
And bars
I love working downtown. There's so many places for food on your break
Hahaha
🤢
Then I’d probably try bussing more but
Untill I probably get a job downtown
Parking does suck but I don’t go downtown so it not an issue for me
Yeah
I hate dealing with parking
Can just dick around on my phone and don't have to worry about parking
No control
I’d feel confined
Really?
I feel more free than driving
Stress me out
I kind of like them when they're not this busy
Busses
I hate
Does not feel good
I'm here dying on the most crowded bus in Ottawa
Feels good
All my windows and doors are open
Haha

<@!331154975457673228> I opend my door
Thunda!
Christ
The doors werent even able to close
I'm surprised the bus driver is continuing to let people on
I have legit never seen a bus as busy as the one I'm on
yeah they just have internal sensors
but im 99% sure it does not have a way to tell temprature outside of itself
I wish my phone could do it
I need a way to read temprature in my apartment
outside is 2 degree warmer

Oh my god
Yeah
ah that happens when you dont comply with academic probation
I remember he wasn't allowed to go back to Carleton for a little while
True
could just be outdated info thoug
facebook
Ahh haha how'd you find that out so quickly?
Nevermind he is still at gonq for business
But that's good
Haha back and forth
I think back at Carleton but I might be wrong
Is he still going to Algonquin do you know?
past*
yeah hah, I wonder if some day he will be passed all that, pretty sure he is working on a degree so mayve
Kurt sure was somethin
"we gotta do a heist on james mcquade to get him back for this"
"please stop selling heroin, son"
Ahhh classic
his mom or some older woman was with him and it reminded me a lot of like norma driving kurt to the courtroom
and sold through the government
imagine how empty the courts would be is all drugs were decriminalised
yes lol
Almost definitely drugs
I wonder what he was there for
:/
Weird red and brownplaid suit and suit pants
Quick court run on my luncu
It was a don cherry suit
Maybe it was me
Haha
I bet the lawyer had to beg him to wear the suit even
He was a pretty normal looking guy
He literally sorta looked like you Nick haha
I bet his lawyer was pissed
Yeah...
Nice thing to advertise in the court
If it's real
It’s like bragging about having killed someone
Yes
Doesn’t a teardrop tattoo mean you killed someone too?
Why would you wear a snapback to court
I feel like a suit does nothing for you if you have a SnapBack and tear drop tattoo
Jesus
The courthouse*
And he was on the phone yelling at someone about how if they message him they will he arrested
I just saw a guy like our age come out of the courtroom wearing a niceish plaid suit, but with a SnapBack on and a tear drop tattoo
lol

:)
Stacey sent me this meme

She reminds me of my old boss and I swear to go I’m not putting up with that again
she was just like “I just wann k ow why you didn’t get it done? Costco was finished on evening and I’ve worked buisy we nights and was able to get it done”
What did she say?
U have to fill the fridge
No no she wanted u to tell customers to wait see
I DID EVERYTHING ELSE
Bitch why u complaining
Under half an hour
“Because I’m the only one on cash and I had to do everything else”
she came up to me and was like “it took me under a half hour to fill the fridge why wasn’t it done last night?”
Tell me

(not very ethical though)
they will even eat chicken
any chance for some protein
generalists vs specialists
completely omniverous
they do eat meat
and send poor mr.cluck to the *other* farm
will I have to teach the chickens how to eat meat
but what if im dead broke and it rains 😦
Only time u gotta get hay for them is winter and sometimes rainy days
https://tenor.com/view/yogscast-sips-facepalm-gif-14024831
maybe if I start the game up again I will have to get animals
And they munch on that
U can buy grass and plant it
oh thats a relife
And they're not too high maintenance
They never die!
and lol nick
all i know about it is a youtuber i watched lost the egg hunt every year and had mad rage
I was worried if I got animals they might be high matinance and I would run out of money to feed them and they would starve
lmao
lmoa
All I did was try to fuck the townspeople
only ever plant farm
I never made farm animals when I played it
I loved the little chicken farm

I always avoid talking about anything relationship related because it depresses me when they stop talking to me because they find out I have a boyfriend
lol
"fucking slut I'm a nice guy come on"
I didn't
;~;
And then he gets all defense and pretends he was never hitting on you in the first place

🎂
<@!136253782131474432>
Happy birthday Nick btw hahah
I actually wanted this game so bad
I know around 4 of the expansions (events, senarios, gambit, and one last one) wont effect the deck cuz they all happen at the start of game or trigger when drawn
I sent you a snap
<@!296572507241054209> it’s a game on steam
Also there's be way too many cards with all the expansions haha
Findlay what have you done to my poor website
fin thats disgusting
with all the expansions
imagin what the game would be like

Awe man
Haha
we KNOW its new lol
yea senario is prob good
no nvm
also
they sound like they could be fun
It's easier to carry around
ok
I'm going to get scenarios
or if
aka lets us play 4 player
Is says only 2 player
the base game again with new stuff
if colonoy wars is like
Im not 100% sure
🤤🤤
Uh
What anime is this
i cant tell
I dont know if that was work appropriate
😍
Colony wars or scenarios
Hello
Oh
Guys need vote
<@!296572507241054209>
THEYRE GOBBINS

Bawblins
are this glib globs
!!!!!!!!

But I get $1450 tonight
I have $20 and -$850 on my credit card :)
yes
for the whole month?
:(
I got food with nick
Oh fuck shon
how do you food
for the month
7$ to my name
currently
I have
:(
I am ironicly dead broke
they look fun
ur name though shon
I would buy you all of the hybrid decks
if I could
I wish I could pay
colony wars
what ever you guys want, i can chip for bday present
poh yea thats like a fuck tone more cards
I think the senerio, and if its there, Crisis: Events are cool
They also have colony wars
The packs a re a bit more expensive than I expected so I may only get one
Oh ok so you think we should get that?
cheanges the base rules
Ok
Yes
thats the scenarios
looks like something close to the sun?
see the blue-ish deck to the left?>
in thep icture you took
nuick
oh thats why we started with 5 instead of 10 cards
yea
I think you're supposed to have two base games for playing more than 2 player
lol
so youd have two base games
i think its base+game plus more
maybe is has some other cards too

I think
thats what we have
so uh
and hydra
hunter
of
Remeber how we read the rules
"Full color rulebook for two player PVP games, and awesome multiplayer formats like Free-For-All, Hunter, and Hydra!"
This box contains a complete game for 1-4 players with rules and 152 cards, including an all-new 80-card trade deck and 8 oversized solo/co-op challenge cards. To expand for more players, simply add an additional Star Realms Core Set or Colony Wars deck for 1-2 additional players.
Oooh
i might be wrong tho
I think frontiers is the base game nick
I think
I didn't get it in the picture but it's the size of two of the base deck
wow
$24
how much is it? $
Frontiers is a huge expansion
Yep!
hybrid cards
he ones of the right are gybrid decks
Are you at Fandom II
Ah, there they are
However there is no Dust like in hearthstone. You get rarity cards from either packs, or after opening enough packs you just get em for free. You use a rarity card of the same rarity of the card you want to craft to get it.

and old mtg has lots of invinite stuff. Standard does not so much.
A pack is like 100g, you get up to I think 500g a day form winning or losing
attack with 1, restart attack with other, repeat
which he has a combo for
well infinite turns if you duplicate it
infinite turns
Housemate also has a card that restarts your turn every time it attacks
You can get more cards free
you can just craft the card you want.
P2W?
its basicly like hearthstone economy
where you can use your coins to just... get the card you want?
yeah its supposedly better
Maybe the paper version. Have you seen MTG:A?
MTG is unplayable for people with regular average cards
right, what im saying is you cant deal with that shit unless youve spent $2000+ on cards
and there are counters
but current standard in mtg has combos that get you to the 4 digget mark in health
so he plays it and table flip game over
and you start with 20 health
sure, that sounds great
I mean
and in MTG its 60
My housemate has a card that makes your health equal to your deck size
MTG is way more P2W
Haha
but agro beats it :p
control is the pay-2-win deck
yeah theres some OG cards that are fucked
just you have to play agro
Hearthstone you can do fine in with dirt cheap decks
So it's had a lot of time to pick up baggage
MTG is also ancient
If youre rich and have a brokenly good card you win
MTG has so many cards that its broken
Tbf hearthstone is also p2w as much as magic
But I know there's a way to put mons on ur steam without it
not balanced? modren mtg is very balanced
My debit visa
its not balanced at all
Hearthstone is a mildly edited (for the better) mtg
and its worse
Mine also doesn't work!
Lol but it came first
lol
And there's been deck building games for ages
magic is just a worse hearthstone
mtg
yea
I feel like
uh
Magic came way way way way before hearthstone
Looks like the price of the expansions is 5$-7$ avrage, with one sticking out at 15$
Literally everything is an editted hearthstone
what card game do you think came first?
I saw
i made my first weekly movie post
https://www.starrealms.com/sets-and-expansions/
there are a lot of expansions
Anyway
Same lol
my debit has a visa symbol on it but still doesnt work
have not got one
I have tried
Oh those
No idea how you get one
I've definitely been able to put mons in without having a cc
Apparently there are things called visa debits
I feel like I have tried these in the past and they have failed me
Least I always did
Or PayPal
I feel like a lot of people would be offended by that statement fin
U can do wif debit
And also, I like, dont have the ability to put money on steam. I dont have a credit card :p
There is also a senerio set, where the base rules of the game is changed
everything is just a new version of hearthstone
if you know one card game you know them all
and I dont have a clue
there is one expansion that adds a full feldge deck that can be played by itself
Oh how does that even work
an expansion adds hybrid ship-basses
Lol
Lop
"discover time travel"
There is an expansion that adds alternate win conditions secretly
Hahaha
they are hard to read lol
I cant tell
another I think pervents all damage once
Get 3 cards for free from the trade row
Another is like
Oh noice
"Deal 10"
one gambit just says
Well like

Probably
So field wiping
Oh damn
but keep hidden from other players
that you can use at any time
And also gambit cards are basicly one-time-use supper cards
But it's cheap
Awe
:(
Multiplayer is paid
Is it free? I'd totaly get it. otherwise I am piss broke lol
i have i ton steam
Pack
I'll take a look for the events pavk
Btw Shon you should get the game on steam and we could play online too
adds random events
The events set is the one I talked about
Haha yeah crisis must be what I have
There are other crisis cards: Events and Heros.
So are they like the weapons in hearthstone?
You got "Crisis: Bases" set. I see the same card art lol. You might also have "Crisis: Fleets and Fortresses" but not sure
Ooh
there is "Gambit" which is 9 cards, but each player starts with 2. You can chose when to use their powerful ability.
So there is quite a few
let me check
How many are there?
and what ones you got
but I dont have a clue what the epxansions actualy hold
its probobly the best single expansion. I would think if you picked up 2 mono colour expansions, picking up the other two would be good too
Id hate to lose from an event
haha yea
Oh I want that. It'd change the game quite a bit. Could be for the better or worse
there were a lot of others too
Like one was "Black hole" where everyone has to discard up to 2 cards, or take 4 damage from each card they did not. Another was "Trade Agreement" where the player whos current turn it is gets 4 extra gold, and gets a ship of 3 or less for free, but everyone else draws 2 extra cards for their next turn.
Like damage or healing?
Oooh that sounds super cool! What kind of events?
causing an effect to everyone
it instantly activates
but when it enters the trade row
in the deck
where an event is like
There is also an expansion that adds events I think
Yeah true hahaha
and no blue
lol
an ass-load of green cards
so we dont have like
make sure you try to even out what you get
I already gave two mono color
If you get dual
Hero expansion or dual colour is what I'll look for
Ooh
Might see if a game place downtown has any
I saw for expansions, there are mono-color expansions, DUAL colour expansions (where a card is BOTH yellow-green, or yellow-blue) Hero expansions, etc.
I could pick up another expansion today
Like, this is all theory
True
I dont know the cards still
Hahaha
I just wanted to know what each colour did
lol
so the combos I posted are how I theorize the dual card types play out
I feel like you've done enough research now to destroy us as a raid boss
Those would be good combinations
and lol a classic
thats based off my knowledge of:
Blue has the most money and healing and good high cost cards
Red has self scrap and good bases with base synergry but lower-then-avrage ships
Green has lots of card draw and the highest damage ships but low money
Yellow can self discard, draw cards, and cause forced discards; they also have -slighlty- higher damage then red and blue, but less then green.
Like I didn't even know one existed but two?
It's two 88s
I had to take a picture of this

no coppy pasted
on how they work
This is my belife
knwoledge
Is that copy pasted or is that your knowledge
How I think the dual colours work
Also what I said is my theory based on what I have learned playing and seeing cards in action
Kinda no
Blue-red is slow burn but late game monster.
Blue-yellow is lockdown control, you have lots of good cards and stop the enemy from using theirs. 
Blue-green is more tempo, you deal damage and build economy equally
Red-yellow is card manipulation master, letting you get the card you want every single draw
Red-green is efficient agro, as you will only have the strongest cards left to kill
Green-yellow is hyper agro, discarding enemy deck as you draw all of your own.
https://www.quora.com/Is-light-ageless
Get outta hwre
XD
Lol
but lightbulbs get old and die
Light is Ageless
I just made a fucked up realisation
bc time will stop
im going to build a speed of light ship and then even if the runner is an inch from the line i will win
The comparison made is imagin if your in a race. Rushing Agro is liking starting out sprinting to then finish line. You don’t pick any economy. Getting economy and scrap cards is like walking to your car to start it. Once you start your car, you will be a lot faster then the runner, but he might have already won.
https://www.instagram.com/p/BwXdRSZAJSJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
...so if you rush mono green and blow them up, they won’t get their
They will hit a critical mass you can’t beat
But if you see somone is building red-blue to have a massive endgame
lol that’s ok
but im just gonna keep posting belle delphine
The basic just is either buying economy cards at the start to ramp up fast, or going STAIR FUCKOG AGRO
i know you guys are talking about relevant topics
https://www.instagram.com/p/BwSbvVzF1Lj/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link
Also there are different play styles you can go for depending on what the trade row has to offer
But it’s easy to do.
The only real way to beat critical mass is to achieve it yourself :p
but not the other game modes
right, but with targeting each other with 4 players, that gets slowed down
actually just skip the first one and go through til the end
Also another thing I read about star realms is that games don’t take that many rounds to win, and usually win by someone hitting critical mass and snowballing to victory. But it’s intended.
second one

wtf
this shit is fucking hilarious and fuck anyone who talks shit about my meme goddess

Maybe people hate the fact she has made money off of her appearance. Aka people feel she has not “worked” for anything even if it’s a job in and of itself just to upkeep Snapchat and stuff.
nah shes not THAT cute but she really knows how to use maneurysms and cosplay and stuff to get people really fired up
shes really CUTE
but she is smart and makes "STONKS" off of horny people
they hate her success
and i dont get it

Also the gamer girl pee meme is old, now it’s bath water meme
Just like the good old lan days
<:shrekdab:586271654204932126>
Yes
Card games are the best kind of LAN
I wonder if you get one based on a single colour, so like there are just a fuck more green cards in the deck lol
And your belle delphine bath water
Some add just general cards
Other expansions add cards of one colour
Get your gamer girl pee ready
Like some expansions add multi-colour cards
O YA
I saw some expansions, there are cool ones
ITS GOING to be a REAL GaMErZ night boys
I wonder if Luke
I cant remember the name
it mostly added bases
and uuuh
I hate it
Do you know what ones nick?
how do you like my website edit nick
Oh yea. The expansions change some stuff up
oo
btw I own two expansioms
Yep
Red + Yellow is card  control
Red-blue is late game monster.
So like going green-yellow is hyper agro
Otherwise you won’t get synergies
You usually only want to go for 2 colours for your deck
Yea wish he could.
But less then green.
Yellow has -slightly- higher damage then red and blue.
wish matt could play too
Also
oh
Blue is money bois
make other people discard
Finnaly yellow is about card manipulation. Draw, discard, etc. They can draw more, discard their hand to draw, and discard opponents hands.
nice syngery
yellow is money bois
base bois
Red has the scrap ability, letting them fix up their deck. They also have lots of bade synergy and the strongest bases
need to constantly buy new cards
Red is self scrap city
Green is high Agro; highest damage, lowest trade, lots of card draw
fun
ahhh noice
So it looks like blue is all about getting more trade and authority (money and health) with very high cost unitys
I was looking up stuff
Also fin
Nice.
i think star realms
Also did nick have plans for today or did we decide to go for starrelms?
>:)
And it’s all sideways and gross
i saw that
I joined on mobile

not sure why all my emojis are black by default
👦⬜
lmao
Hahaha just a piece of flesh to wrap around a skinless emoji skull
🏻
well i mean the skin tones ones are literally just humans + skin colour lol
Yeah I guess it's just a recipe for outrage
no more 'craft your own emoji'
I guess they got rid of some combos
🏳🌈
and then + crossed out sign
pride flay was white flag + rainbow emoji
And we're so mad
lol
I loved the people thinking apple added it as a new emoji
you could also combine flags of different colours
Yeah hahaha
and didnt think about that
they just made the crossed out emojie combinable with any other emoji
It was a legitimate thing for non hateful reasons
That was hilarious
Oh lmao I remember that
thanksfully they removed that
oh god lol
🏳️‍🌈🚫
oh remember when there was an crossed out price flag emojie
🏿
Seen it lol
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=11_-1_hvExU
its racist against asians to use the yellow one
its white supremacist to use the white one
oh no
It's racist to use the black emojis

Yeah definitely
its easy with a casual position too
My boss is insanely chill about days off
Oh nice!
Yeah I asked for the day off
Ah yeah that too
Ohhh yeah I hadn't noticed that yet. I just hated the disconnect from their mouth movements to their speech. It's like watching a gitchy video where the audio is lagging behind
also you called in today right?
but it always is so noticeable and gross
Like when someone is far away they try to make them quieter etc
The dubs are so nasty because they try really hard for the sound editting to sound good but it never sounds natural at all
hahaha
They're different so it was confusing
That was nasty
lmao
I was watching how to sell drugs with both subs and dubs on lol
because for the narration its not noticeable
It was really throwing me off
yes lmao
Dubbed live action is definitely kinda gross
Subs > Dubs
I dont watch it with dub
And lol that kind of sounds cool
Sub or dub but yeah
Oooh I haven't watched that yet. That was the ehhh German? dubbed one eh?
my dream was just stranger things but with like ghosts and time travel lmao

<@257986741896609802> <@428365437923753992> I basically didn't sleep last night so I'm pretty tired and was wondering if I had to postpone D&D would you be alright with Wednesday?

loooooking good
Yes lmao
to test it

Hell yeag
autoscroll works
null joined the chat
undefined left the chat

It's probably a mix of all those things
http://35.183.42.174
I think its probably exercise, using bright screens in bed, and potentially a kratom side effect
wow so you can rule out bad sleep schedule then
I usually get up at 8 or 9
okay nice!
Especially on Sundays
Never after 12
if its after 12pm thats nott gewd
when do you normally wake up on sunday morning
Hahaha
I never slept better after that mosh pit saturday night
The lack of sleep thing is probably a big combo of lifestyle things
And I do need to exercise
Yeah I usually do because it always makes me even more tired in the morning
(Dependance, side effects)
Avoid medicating at all costs
(Stairs, walking)
Exercise during day
(The light fucks your circadian rhythm)
No going on phone in bed
What I can recommend:
jeez
Or no sleep even
Yeah it's basically the same for me except with even less sleep lol
im on 5 hours rn
but it always refreshes after that
so i function with like 5-6 hours of sleep every monday
and for me it means i cant sleep until 2am on sunday night
i do it
yeah it might ruin sleep schedule
ahhh
I think I need to stop sleeping in and going to bed late on weekends
No! I used to get anxious about getting no sleep and that would keep me up but the last two times I haven't even
Also ive heard people suggest vigourous exercise as a method of sleep encouragement
anything in particular keep you up?
It's another 0 hours of sleep dat
ohhh no
I didn't sleep at all so I may want to move it depending on how I feel :(
DnD tonight?
Yeah for real
i feel like for $2.1B something shouldnt take like 7 years to make
yeaaah
If we're even alive by thrn
So far it'll probably be done by 2100
lol
the rail will go to kanata and orleans and the airport by 2040

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoCJ8lqfQVE
noice
Just looked it up, it does not matter for ally abilitys. AKA play em in whatever order you want
Which I'm thankful for haha
It looks like it does not matter in that case.
BUT
and 2, play order would matter more
one, its harder to go multi-aliance becuase you are less likey to get the trigger off
it would, but it would mean 2 things if it was true:
but the ability tirgering of ships only really matter for a few cards.
If that was the case it'd be hard to ever chain aliance effects
Yea
I wouldn't really like it otherwise
It has to work like that
However aliance benefits, as far as I can tell, are retroactive. If you draw an aliance card and you had one in play, it -looks- like it triggers it. But im not sure on that.
For some reason I thought there was no order of events
Damn
That makes those final crazy combos a little weaker
basicly, you do have a hand, and play order can matter. The blob trade ship is brought up becuase it lets you scrap a card from the trade row AND gives you money. If you want to use its ability to scrap a card from the trade row, you have to use it BEOFRE you get the cards money (Abilities are used before anything else)
Same is true if you have to discard something from your hand
you dont get that cards benefit.
if you chose your hand instead of discard pile
becuase
But scrap is weaker then we thought
Yea
That's good to know
Ok lmao yeah junkyard is fucking awful if it's not optional
makes it so junkyard is not actualy a negitive card
Abilities from outposts ARE optional. I looked and its been clarified
One last thing
That kinda sucks tbh
and play order CAN make a large difference. Like the blob ship that lets you scrap cards from the trade row? You have to use that ability the moment you play the card, so if you want to buy something first you have to play that card later
Damn that changes a lot
Ooooh
also it turns out we made a mistake with Scraping. You DO have a 'hand'. Meaning if you scrap a card, you dont get its benefit (unless its a ship that has a scrap benefit)
Also that's a good idea!
Oooh
also <@!136253782131474432> <@!331154975457673228> I had an idea on how to play starrelms with missing starter cards; we could use the autority cards and say "this is a scout"
<@!136253782131474432> its a refrence to the Shadowfell. The Shadowfell and Feywild are mirrors of the normal world, but the Feywild everything is 'enhance' and supper saturated, while the Shadowfell is 'dead' and desaturated
😂😂
He was sitting right next to me and I didn't even notice

It's not the astral plane right?
<@257986741896609802> what DnD thing is the upside down referencing? Like the place that is identical to the normal world but mostly uninhabited and evil
Yeah! I'm binging it haha
Is it good
No I haven’t!
Or <@257986741896609802>
<@331154975457673228>
Have you started stranger things 3 yet
Lol
Update relationship status on fb
He be sending me smiley faces and shit
He's like if I ever come back to Ottawa we should meet up!! And I'm like !! Oh no!!
I think someone from my old college course may be flirting with me but I'm not sure because he was such a friendly dude and I don't wanna be rude like I have a boyfriend!!! If he's just being nice but I also don't wanna lead him on
one day
thats ok tho
it was just one of those bucket list things i had
cuz i play them SO MUCH
nick doesnt much like them anymore because i made him sick of them 😢
only band i've ever fallen madly and deeply in love with
i just wanted to see them
😦
Well if it makes you feel any better they aren’t that good live
Aw dang yeah
so mad i couldnt have gone to alt j though
its so cool
i know!!!
wow it gets lit later in
i'd literally go so fucking mental to this song
its literally boondocks style its so sick
it has us in the first half
this music video
ill check it ot
no
its really cool
u ever heard this one by her
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coLerbRvgsQ
lol
i'd mosh the fucking shit out of billie eilsh
never thought i would mosh to that
holy shit
and they moshed to it
also one band covered rocket man by elton john
bet i could survive that
lol
lo
wonder if i could start a mosh at a lana del rey concert
hahahaha everyone can experience the mosh
they should have seperate pits for people of different heights
all people my height just *pit*
i'd fight in the pit if it was fair
fight in the pit
yes definitely
but still good way to get out that bad agressive energy
some pits are actual fighting and that sucks
just body on body
i mean your not like *ACTUALLY* fighting of course
but not arms outstretched pushing
just all pushing
not like metal show assholery
noone was throwing their arms around in these
im a ball of fiery rage which cannot be sated literally because i will die
but i cant because i would literally die
*FIGHT*
fucking *CHAOS*
i've *always* wanted to mosh
yes lol
ur probably just sweating off the pounds
very primal
and its very visceral
its a lot of exercise which is graet
lets u release the bad energy
like a sauna
i feel like moshing would be so cleansing
hahahaha
i'd get so grumpy getting sweaty man squished
https://tenor.com/view/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-crushed-battle-of-the-bastards-gif-12221016
everyone wants to see
because tiny stage
everyone squishing each other
hahahaha
it was more squishy than mosh
this one was like battle of the bastards
being wide i feel could possibly be usedful
like i was totally fine
I think tallness is the ony advanta
but i think i'd literally die
short dudes get rekt
i like to pretend im sturdy
i think just being tall
u basically gotta be a dude or like at the very least somewhat sturdy to mosh
aw thats nice
they asked her if she was okay and stuff
but people were nice about it
hahahaha like a brick wall
i saw one girl get shouldered in the head
All the chubby tall guys were indestructible
your going to get trampled and ruin the fun
like no go away
moshing i feel people would literally throw me out
maybe
hahahaha broken nose
so* much
youd probably be elbowed to much
i always wanted to mosh
:/
i get elbowed in the face
everyones elbow height
youd likely get so rekt in the pit at your height
all over my face
peoples sweaty backs
i feel being short i'd be so cranky about it all
thats actually impressive
oh my god
I had finger wrinkles from all teh sweat
i dont even like dance floors at bars
yes
their sweaty sweat all over me
being pressed against other people
i'd hate that
dang bleh!!
sauna
breathing literally felt like a saunda
maybe hotter than 36 lol it was probably like body temperature at least so like 37
hahahahaha oh nooo
my shirt is still soaked i could wring it out
dripping
i was drenched in sweat
holy shit
and it was like 36 degrees in there
huge mosh pits for 2 of the shows
plus targ is hard to listen to concerts at 😦 i'd probably have not been too fun to have hahaha
i was too sleepy tho
i should have went with nick to targ!!
Fluke
It was a total surprise!
im really jealous !!
oh dang!
he was technically the headliner, since he has more followers than PUP
and did a little act including the love yourself part
well i mean he performed at the show
i feel so bad but i dont think i could hear anything he said without non-stop quoting the vine
yes he is preaching love and acceptance
I LOVE HIM I RESPECT HIM
AHHHHHHH]

AHHHHHHHH
FINN
yes
WHAY
WHAT
A VINE GUY

There was a line around the block
It’s super sold out now

Oh dope I'm down!
if matt is free friday we may be able to do dnd then!
nice!
oooh
So I can have a beer
Ill meet my mum at home at 7
Not sure if ill go to bluesfest friday, I think will sautrday
So potentially DnD/Board games friday though?
ohhhk do you need to be home for a specific time?
I'll see if I can work something out so I can still have a drink
Oh shit ok man
so I gotta do some organising
and their first show is pencilled in for Jul 31
and by stuff i mean im sorta the band manager for Nate's band! Haah
Ive got some stuff im supposed to do at home tonight, and ive been invited to some american friends July 4th party later too! So not sure I want to venture far from downtown ;/
😗😗😗
Any chance you'd want to come by the apartment instead of a pint out <@331154975457673228>
Before she goes on a three week trip tomorrow
Ahhhh my mum has to come by my apartment to set up one of my old phones for my sister
Hahaha
many deep apologies for content spam
also didnt realise i wasnt in the leet coders den chat rn
yeah i really should be doing more documentation
Nice documentation!
Boom now its in the documentation
Special Case 1: When only depth to bedrock is reported. Example: E-2006 HOLENO.107.
Create a non-descript unit describing the overburden, with the unit_bottom_ft or unit_bottom_m value representing the depth to bedrock. Then, create the bedrock unit with no entry or <Null> for unit_bottom, since this depth is not known. This way, scripts deriving depth to bedrock, which can be thought of as the unit top, can still do so in a standard way, by pointing to the bottom of the unit above.
Oh ok cool
and then make that the standard method of data entry from here on out
so I need to make 3 more manually
its only 3 entries
Nah I can just do it manually
Which won't be fun
That's gunna require a fairly large change to the code though
Ahhh ok
So I need to duplicate each of the rows and just keep the unit_bottom empty for half
and then a unit above it with the known bottom, which is synonymous with the top of the other one
what I should do is add a unit pair for them, giving a bedrock unit with an unknown bototm
Well the data is sorta wrong in a wauy
How different is the data then
since there isnt a unit above
They improperly report the top of bedrock as the bottom
How do these do it?
Gdi so those require another script
unit above it*
Yeah
these ones dont have any units above them reported....
So before, we always found top of bedrock by looking at the bottom of the unit about it right
Fuuuck what is it
RUINED
Awwwwww this data ruins the code
Woooo what's it this time
yay bad data
Ah its an error in the data again
Oh!
oh maybe it inverted
about 75% are now 'test' instead of 25% lol
So close
Try it!
so maybe I can remove that conditon all together
Or something
Don't do anything
So maybe a check if the ID is null
Oooh
theres no ID to match even
Its the ones that done have entries in the second table
Oh shit that was fast
I figured it out
My man
Lamo
machine learning coding time
You gotta find what the trend is
Then yeah
So maybe keep that condition
No idea what the trend is for those though hah
and updates like 4 of the non null to 'test' lol
but it keeps some null
after
Is that before setting it all to null
weird so when i change the else to add a different value than null it updates some but not others haha
yeah
Or less conditions
It may have to have more conditions
Its definitely an issue with the else
so I think it needs a better fix where it legit updates them all
the only reason it works right now is because it sets all 147 values to null, but then doesnt update the null ones when i run it again
yeah it is, im not sure if that would work even
It's kinda nasty
true
otherwise it doesnt output the correct number of values
You could add another loop before it all that just nullifies them
So basically I need them all to be set to null before it writes the proper values in
Lmao yeah that first thing is a bit of an issue
#2: Make it a function
#1: Right now it only works if I accidentally set them all to null using the broken else, and then delete it and run it again. lol
Also your boss better be happy
What are thoseM
mostly, two last things to implement into the code
?
Awesome! So its all good now? And you have everything fixed with the dataM
means it wasnt the code that was broken, it was the data
yeah thats a good thing
Cool! And is that ok?
and yea im down!
so after removing spaces and setting the case to be the same it went from 88 values to 119
Still wanna grab a beer today?
Haha
wish i was at home lol
How about youra
Wish I got to go home lol
hows work
<:ye:591002869881372705>
😩
its so nasty
why is your profile picture to squished
Yeah they're some expensive pieces of hw
network switches can be like $8k
dang that means you cant go home
jeez
Not me yet
Fuck it's back for my friend
Apparently a network switch blew up or something
It's still down
:I
Still not as bad as the time someone left a dev machine on running an Azure task that cost the CSC $50,000 over a weekend
This will cause a lot of lost money
Oh definitely lmao
someone is probably freaking out trying ot fix it somewhere
damn
The other floors are also having the issue
Apparently it's all of the CSC that's down
Everyone is just away from their cubicle talking to each other
hahahah
Also it feels like I'm in HS waiting for them to send us home because the power is out
thats true lol
Which would be nasty
Lmao I'd have to do it through my phone
jk I dont think theres anything left to fix
<:1534149299mouai:591006414017921035>
😉
u should fix my code
Im bored
:/
Fuck you CSC

“If the Internet is off for 15 minuets we are legally allowed to leave”
If it stays off for an hour they may send us home lmao
CSC internet just went down lol
Oh god why

I guess it's because it's a string library function
Yeah it's odd
you have to do string.lower()
lower is weird
No annoying logic
Just go through every value and set the row to lowercase
yep
That'd be an easy script
That's a good idea
so i can do it above in an earlier update cursor
I might want to update the table with the lowercased values though
Ohhhhhh Interesting
To lower(row) == to lower(entry)
Yeah, just lowercase both values so they have the same capitalization
So they should technically be exactly how they were reported so it can be duplicated by any other data entry person some day, but maybe lowercasing all is not a bad compromise
the ID's were created on a "Loyal" basis to the reports from which they originate
Well so the disgusting thing is
Or upper case it all
You can just lowercase it all
Oh
😠
HOLE NO.7
HOLE No.7
with string ID's
thats a pretty gross problem ill probably run into a lot
the ID's dont match
Ah i think I know what happened
No problem dude
but thank again man
Hahaha
haha dude you gotta do your own job lmao
Just gotta get some documentation done this morning while the bosses are around haha
and yeah no worries man
not an easy problem, im not sure whats wrong with it but ill try to find out
I can help you out closer to the end of the day again if you want
:(
😦
Noooo
it makes no sense
after some checking for some reason it has most of the values right, but then a bunch it just makes <null> even though they hit bedrock
Oh no really?
😦
it is but it isnt
So the script isnt actually working btw
The programmers life
Hahaha fuck
it was also way too hot last night
yeah i was literally trying to figure out what variables would be needed to stop me from dreaming about programming
All you can think about are writing if statements and declaring variables
It's awful
I've been there
Hahahaha fuck
I just had a dream where I tried to write a script that will make me stop having programming dreams
I can’t stop having programming cycle dreams

Like it's not sexy
Like a story I read (it was real shit) this girl was picking pine needles out of herself
Like show how dirty and awful it was
I hate that
I just remembering watching this video analysis breaking down a lot fo TV and movies and showing little things that directors do for rape scenes that are really bad... and end up depicting them in a way that sexualises it more than it does show the degree to which it is heinous and unacceptable, like sneaking in a sense of foreplay, showing camera angles that show the sexiness of the woman, or not showing blood or bruises or the realities of it
I love it
It's taking the stereotype of romance novels and making it really awful :D
Hard to explain
It is a romance novel so there is some sexualization but it's very self aware
right i can imagine
It's Korean so the culture is very different
Just lots of crying
So no laws or anything
Well the thing is like a web comic
does sound interesting yeah
And oh :o
It's cool
Like feeling genuine feelings of affection for this character that keeps hurting you and you know he's really really terrible
rather, to show it as the heinous act it really is
there is a big debate about sexualising rape scenes in art / shows / books. There is actually a standard for how it should be depicted to avoid sexualisation
Like it's like your IN the relationship too
Like it messes with you pretty impressively
Which is really impressive
No it's actually very very refined
probably a low-key porn manga
people probably get off on that unfortunately
It's f u c k e d
Very graphic rape
But like no there's like
And yeah hahaha I agree
lmao
It's the most fucked thing I've ever read
(Walter white)
I read this Korean graphic novel, not not called manga there it's something different but it's called killing stalking and the amount of severe severe abuse in it is crazy
really enjoy it, but if you want to be Don, or if you want to be Walter, or if you want to be joker, youre doing something wrong
https://tenor.com/view/madmen-what-women-want-whocares-gif-5036489
Ooh :o
very popular show
Show about the 60s
I've never heard of it
Mad men?
like you need to know that distinction
I enjoy watching it, but i dont promote being a Don Draper
or even watching mad men, like its full of awful sexism
Oh eww
like people can enjoy reading about true crime
and yeah its a very different thing
er cover photo
And wait is it
I actually low-key really enjoy reading unhealthy relationship fiction but like obviously I know it's not actually enjoyable At all
bothers me that josh bowes profile pic is joker and harley
yahhhhh. you cant treat someone like harley and assume they would like it
yeah people shouldnt think that thats what they want, or that its okay
you can have controlled sexual stuff in bedroom, but for your entire life to become romatisized abuse is not good
Unhealthy relationships are really interesting to explore in writing and I'm not against enjoying it but you need to know about the #fax most importantly
romantize* abuse
but people sexualise the hell out of abuse though
The animated one was like that too
Most of them are like that
but like the whole story is so obviously one about abuse/control and toxic relationship
Oh yeah!
not that i know much about comic books
theres literally an entire story line where they address that and she takes her life back, with that poison ivy girl
But no it's a terrible relationship
I love joker a lot
I do not like when people promote/endorse the joker+harley relationship in that series. Pretty sure thats just abuse

pls tell me face tattoo
i dont doubt it
lol
He's got a joker tattoo now
Well
yes
Do y'all remember Josh Bowes
You enjoy them all with 0 collection
None of what I listed needs ANY cards on your part
Kobolds and Caracomes, Witchwood, Arena Rumble, Boomsday, then there is the Dalarna Heist.
Save up gold for Dalaran Heist
And work your through em
Start with Kobold a and Katacomes
Well hey enjoy the SP content
Yea. Would have liked to play
friggin offload
:/
Still 3%
I never managed to get it
if this wasnt a co-op job id seriously consider quitting lmao
how is it that the weekend is nearly over already
mines finally working
hows hearthstone install shon?
And yes nick you suck for winning.
Just thought of that
Power-outagefrew <@!331154975457673228>
There's TM beside that u can't see it
Nick sucks ™️
Nick sucks he beat me at pool
Like mao
***Bigfrew***
Yes exactly
Bigfrew
Renfrew but big
It's like
Nick and I are at tailgators and it's so uncomfortable
Perfect.

Pls gif jimmyneutron
He was literally spherical

Pls gif jimmy neutron
He was a sphere
The Phat one
Hahah
I think I’m carol
I’m definitely jimmy
And haha yes I could see that nick
People should go back to calling it the ‘net
I always considered myself Sheen
Satellite interwebs?
Didn’t know that was possibly
And haha oh no
I wonder when our next DnD will be
For me my internet is so slow it just litteraly fails to download
And would use all of my cell data for the month
I have no space on my phone or computer and no power sources for either
Rip
Internet is too slow to download.
😦
Me too
😦
I have been unable to download herthstern
I’m jimmy and nick is Carl
However
Sheen from jimmy neutron
Sheeeeen
Sheen
Lucky Shen
A shower awaiting me
A fan on me
I’m sitting with tv
Rip fin
Still no power here
That sounds fun
Ahhh lucky
Cineplex Ottawa
Renfrew didnt:( I was going to go to movies today’s too
Lucky what theatre has that?
Back at the boogies
It’s ok here. We still have power
Saw John Wick the 3rd
I went to the movies
nop
Is your power back on
It got worse here lol
Oh good
It cleared up
It rained super bad for like two seconds here
How is the weather rn?
Holy.fuck that's terrifying
<@!257986741896609802> that’s a terrible setting I didn’t know that existed

This was from before it went out
Fuck that sucks
Yeah in renfrew its out
In nepean we have power
That's in Renfrew?
Oh fuck
The power just went on and off 12 times
And oh no Shon
Do you have power
wtf that's really dumb
I had litteraly just downloaded it less then 12 hours before. It should not delete something that soon
Why the fuck would apple make that an automatic feature? I had to go and disable it but now I need to reinstall it.
And my phone “offloaded” it automatically (deleted it) becuase it was an app “I don’t use it that often”
And last night I went to play it
So like I downloaded hearthstone yesterday
The doctor told me to put oil in my ear so I'm pretty sure it's safe
IF that's the problem
Usually it comes right out
And I do that for a day or so if it's really bad a couple and then I get a plastic syringe thing that they use on babies for medicine and fill it with warm water and spray it into my ear
Haha fin didn't like the oil but that's what I do
I’ll have to check. How would I get rid of it? The oil thing fin said?
Because build up of earwax can also cause ringing in the ears
I do think you should check to see if it's a build up of earwax though
Fin*
Ok well I’ll keep that in mind fun
😩😩😩😩👌👌👌👌👌P A R I S👌👌👆👆👌😩😩😩😩

thanks!
And <@!136253782131474432> nice switch
And <@!296572507241054209> I’m in renfrew starting tomorrow
<@!257986741896609802>
But it went away on its own
My mum had tinnitus for a long time
It’s possible you got hearing damage somehow, not likely but possible
Also if it sticks around or worsens that might be an issue
Probably not emerge worthy but definitely worth mentioning to your gp
So Shon that’s tinnitus
I *really* like this image

It can also cause ringing
I really think it might be wax
Ok good
If it’s still bad later tonight I’ll tell em
It's probably an easy fix but I don't think it's good to leave it
I maybe should
Haha
Shon tell them
I wanted fins opinion
No
Do your parents know
Shoon
There is now a loud ringing from my right ear that makes it hard to hear anything from my left ear becuase the ringing overpowers stuff
Shon that's not good
But I am home and don’t want to.
Oh no
Shon I think you gotta go to the emerg
Now there is a loud ringing coming from it
Oh fuck dude
But
Still can’t. Supper muffled
Yes
Remember how I said I couldn’t hear out of my one ear?
And everyone else
Also <@!331154975457673228>
It’s not wrong
I love that
Lol

Oh! <@331154975457673228>  u in Renfrew this weekend too?
https://media.tenor.com/images/7a2cc2cd8aaac24609da76d65a444c2b/tenor.gif
Lemme smash
Gotta have you guys over for smash once I get it
Also nice switch
Hahaha
The moment I got out of the car I saw a mosquito
How are the boogies doing
Oh baby
I made it to the boogies

Look at my mii


@everyone
Getting a switch, what game should I get
lol
*Gets a deck wih 15 0 drops*
cursed cards 4 u
"I like your deck... I think I will take it!"
very enjoyable hah
best encounter in hearthstone
yes
yews
did you ever fight RAFAM! THE SUPREAM ARCHEOLOGYS!
and oldgods
or parts of it
i did explorers
i like it
oooooo
in otherwords hearthstone is getting its own little fun bits of story/lore lol
takes the villans from Leauge of Explorers, Kobolds and Catacomes, Old Gods, Witchwood (Thats another SP thing I forgot thats really fun!) and Boomsday and mashes them together
So the Dalaran Heist
yes
Before you do any SP content I will tell you this
*Awful*
Also fin
its fun
hah
Freaks me out
Sensory deprivation
It's like
I hate it
But second
i like that
Not third level
It was second level dark
Yes
?
spooked by the dark
I was very scared
All my things for light died
only thing better would be temporary zombies
keeps things interesting
its like a survival video game!
I was left alone in an old house for 3 hours in pitch black
only one who doesnt benefit is the insurance companies
it sucks when all of our food needed an oven to be ate
i dont think anyone died
yhea we lost power for 4 days
exciting!
adventure!
😠
lol
Ours was 4 days
for 5 mins
the power still went out though lol
Impressive
But the damage
it didnt even rain at my place downtown
Tornados are pretty violent oh fair enough
it was like less than 20 mins
ehhh it didnt last long though
We had a violent storm
hurricanes are like violent 2 day long storms
Remember what happened last time
oh im thinking of hurricanes
I feel like there would be repercussions to that
;-;
a violent 3 hour long thunderstorm would be fun
i wish storms lasted longer than just a few mins
lol
Love the 88
also dont you start in 4 mins
Rain
at
what am i looking qt
🤢🤢

!!!!!
WHATS THE QUESTION
or soryr why wouldnt it be
and why is it not hot shon hah
cozy down there too
Poor beb when under the bed 😢
why is the air *hot*
but
warm days you get lots of storms cropping up near the end of the day
fast evaporation
heat effect storms
poor kenya. She'll cozy up on the dresser
what happend
it was bright and sunny just a moment ago
i love storms
I feel bad for leaving
I've gotta go to work and Kenya seems scared :(
I'm worried
thunder and lightning is very frightning
yes
i was just wathcing the raw power of nature from the window
sounds good will do
and yay!
yes true
but yea check out the SP stuff
I have download hearthstone on phone so I can play it hwen I am home
Anyway, there are stupid cheap decks you can make and win a lot of
if they were good, everyone would always use them forever
becayuse they are AlWAYS avalible
but basic cards are ment to be bad
most are trash lol
oh neat
And yes the recently got new cards added to the basic set to make up for their lost cards
i thought there were testing the jazz festival stage
there is heavy lightning
:(
yes
i guess it was overuse
damn ice block
If I go outside am I gonna get struck by lightning
Ice block, a warlock card, 3 rouge cards, and something else
well
lol
it was sylvana and I think 1 other
ahh neat
They have also put several very OP cards from the basic set into the "hall of fame" aka only usable in wild
if u have money and rare cards you will win
just like magic the gathering isnt balanced at all
Yea
pretty impossible to balance it when theres that many cards
Standard is fairly balanced. Wild is a wild ride
no old gods
or druid stuff
yeah no cthulu stuff even
Standard is just Basic + the last 3 sets
standard is more balanced
Wild is every card every realeased
right i remember that
there is now Wild and Stndard for basic play
Aslo
thats all i remember tbh
I have like Hogger, Spider lady, Shapeshifter boi,
ahh right
but its siiick
i thikn  i only have like 4 legendary cards
the only thing not free is dalaran. Only 2/5 parts are free
ahhhh swett
but its 100% free
Just a cardback I think
Uh
good rewards?
Also
nice heh
some are really fucking hard
I managed to do all the puzzles
huh
its always the same
its a puzzle; all the tools are in your hand
or same cards
No draws.
different draws though?
and its not an infinate combo either.
jesus
you have 1 turn to do leathal.
like one you have to find leathal no 0 minions on the board and the ennemy has over 600 HP
some of the puzzles are really fucking hard
like: Try to get leathal in 1 turn, coppy their board 100%, clear the WHOLE bord in 1 turn, etc

what time are you off fin
yeah <:surprised:590632467116064778>
that sucks
in the winter we basically were blasting our electric heaters non stop
geez
And our apartment is so badly insulated it's insane
We get absolutely destroyed by paying for our electric heating
oh perfect
we dont pay water
So is your water bill expensive
huuuh
its like hot water radiator heading
thats pretty good
Do you guys not have electric heating
That's not bad
but the most we have ever payed for hydro is $40
other than hydro
but yeah 1695 / 3 is utilities included
It's beautiful
Ot

<:ShrekMacjwm25lb5001y01tp9062xezb:591007291671576586>
<:mike3:591711562046111774>
<:winny3:591711351466885149>
omg oh no
In this app
guys you can make the emojis big

with utilities included
ours is 1695 split 3 ways
<:yogret:586272498627379212>
<:shrekdab:586271654204932126>
lot cheaper but yea only 1 bedroom.
Summer is only like $950 though a month
for a one bedroom apartment
When it's winter everything ends up costing around $1150 a month
its a good price
Yea for no hydro cost and eveyrthing
that's actually a pretty good price
but then there is no window
if we got the basement it would be 1200
so we split that 2 ways
1300 for 2 bedroom apartment
like uh
what's your rent again?
I know our rent is more then yours, but it incldes unlimited hydro and stuff
The bill is usually around $32 and then split between us
But we don't usually stress too much about water
We can't do that either
Hahaha
if I want
I can enjoy hour long showers
Also because there is no hydro cost
I like that
I need heat in winter
they have the heat up WAY high
That's good
Its hot usualy
How is it in the winter/
Oh what
Oh man that's lucky
but we cant control the heat 😦
Free hydro for us. Price never changes here thankful
our electricity bill went from $220 in the winter to an estimated $53
Oh yeah cars are expensive af
my not paying for a car helps
dang boi
I gotta do groceries too
yeah
food
rent, car payment, car insurance, phone, internet, utilities
And a few things
I have to pay rent this paycheque
Yeah
I put $250 on it
its at 250 now?
how is it possible you didnt pay it off
also you had 500 on the cc
so two weeks from now
ay
Then put my great but 5 years old CPU in my server
Once i'm done paying off my CC and I have extra cash, i'm going to upgrade my desktop
Actually planning on it
SoonTM
gib cpu pls
lets go to canada computers and ask them for a new cpu
pleb server
It's possible
maybe its your server that cant handle it though
Gotta get that extra Mbs of ram
i will now be able to render 32 chunks instead of 28

this will enhance my minecraft experience

so this app has four different default themes
Yeah that was pretty useful
Hahaha
https://steamcommunity.com/login/home/?goto=%2Fchat%2F
i used to use the browser steam chat lmao
then maybe i would start playing computer games again
if native discord -was- steam itd be amazing
"The code we currently have for steam is too good. There are features we cant make worse without redoing all the code, ground up. So, lets do that."
They just fucked it all up
It was enough that they felt they had to redo their entire chat
in terms of a social platform
I wonder how many users they have lost to discord
Steam has monthly meetings about the steam chat. The first question asked each month is "Ok so how can we make it even worse?"
for some reason i cant even close a chat window while in game sometimes. not only is the UI bad but it doesnt even work properly
God knows how they managed that but they did it
oh god they made it even worse
steam chat is unusable nowadays
Exactly!
non-shity steam chat
<:yogret:586272498627379212>
It reminds me of old steam chat
Me too
And just make it a chat window
bc i sorta like it better
I like how I can disable both sidebars
It's unnoficial

did discord make it or is it unofficial
No chrome
so not chrome
So it uses infinitely less ram
No HTML/CSS UI
It's a natively written version of discord
It's called ripcord
what app is this


lol accurate

I found out outlook has word art

mayhapsuly
youd prob do very well
if you were ever presented with the opportunity to (if tuition became free), would you go back and get an english degree?
ah nice
Like those were my first semester, I took pol semester 2
Oh I took that in like
u just need polisci
I think Soci and Phil were my faves
yes
hit all the social sciences basess
Psych, Soci, Anth, Phil
smort
smert
and I took philosophy
Oh
prehistory, human evolution, and our foundations and cultures
social anthro sucks for the most part, i find phsyical anthro very interesting
we talked about it for a while
it was neat but I did ass
thats what sawyer is in^ anthro/soc
I flunked psychology
ooo yeah
But I had a lot of fun in the sociology/anthropology
sum day
u should go for an english diploma/certificate/degree
they care about how well you can articulate your points and conjure ideas
they no longer care about your spelling (you just use a computer)
u a storee teller
because
I got guud marks
english is my best in uni
and
legally speaking
legally you can
what if I *cant*
but
and hahah you definitely can shon
you said english?
what was your fav class shon?
what if I cant legaly take a computer related course
hmmm ill consider it
Basic circuitry, bitwise operations etc
Computers are fascinating at a scientific level
Or if you have a computer essentials kind of class, I feel like you'd find that neat
Maybe some kind of basic programming
I'll always recommend some kind of CS clase
i need one more class
what class should i take nick
Awesome!
sure!
Any chance you'd want to do pool tonight fin
That'd be awesome

u need an extentable pool table in your apartment

and I was like "huh thats kinda weird but cool I guess"
and I thought you ment pool table
I missread that as carving
I got a pool craving

do you know how to code an AI
but then you have it if you ever need to do this again
coding the AI would take longer than entering all 500,000 rows manually
also the format is diffeernt on every report so youd need like an AI to figure out what values to grab
90% on typed stuff
its only like 75% accurate on this kinda stuff
i use it to copy and paste stuff
got it
Yeah OCR
a program that can auto detect text from images
OCR?
you need like
:(
the script cant read this unfortuntaely

wright a script to do it for you can you
no
automate
you cant like
Dont worry theres only 500,000 rows that need to be entered

heheheh
WOW
Is that the correct way to ask that
data
What are you entering?
toxic data entry
chronically
ugh this data entry is killing me

long slow and painful

its okay the bleach will only chronically kill you
How much bleach can you drink without dying go
Drinking the bleach
Always crying in the Walmart
😔😔😔
jk
too bad yur only level 2
They're level 3
My favorite spells
Like 'be calm don't cry in the Walmart' and 'dont drink the bleach'

Yes
you should have one of thoe baby carriers but have kenya in it
In Nick's spot
She's good and quiet when she's able to sleep next to me >u>
shes loving life
See what I mean tho

Oh man she just tripled this pose

oh yeah
Yeah! I never thought it was a movie for children though, seems pretty well garnered to everyone
the plot was it was a story being told to a kid from his grandpa/uncle
Very contrived
the story that is
It was based on a book , I thought it was just like
they used to always play it on nickelodian
it was told to a kid
And I didn't think it was :O
Oh wait it is critically acclaimed
its a kids movie though right
ahh yes haha
Cult classic sorry
Or wait
is it?
So
I didn't mind it! Its critically acclaimed
"he's only mostly dead"
only saw as a wee lad
good movie!
I never watched it until like, last year
lmao
one of the only movies I have watched
it is
"Ha-ha, you fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders, the most famous of which is “Never get involved in a land war in Asia,” but only slightly less well known is this: “Never go in against a Sicilian, when death is on the line!”"
is that princess bride
lmao
""I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder"
u become imune
Hahaha good
if you consume enough poison
she got charged eventually
working at the bayshore in ottawa
That's awful oh my god
she was puking all the time
Wh-
in ottawa
for a year
or something
or water bottle
some coworker sprayed windex on their enemies cup
but yes very true
can be large dose of less toxic things too
While making it seem like they're just sick the whole time
asbestos
In small doses u can murder someone very slowly
rat poison is acute for rats, chronic for humans
just kidding :p
:(
oh no shon
Stop eating rat poison here and there
Speaking of poison: I need everyone who ate one of those pears to make a Constition saving throw
of low* level
Like rat poison over a length of time can make you very very very sick but you can improve if you like u kno
Chronic = "My liver failed after 2 years o flow level exposure"
Acute = "Oh no im disabled now and might die"
youre thinking of chronic vs acute effects
some poisons just make you wish you were dead
Instantly
then yeah sure i agree
but if youre talking about "we havent heard of rosemary, therefore its prob less bad"
Like some poison doesn't just kill you
theres no way of knowing unless you make deductions on a microbiological scale
Like I'm just guessing if it's bad for a cat this is probably what would happen
or conduct a study
we would have to read papers about that lol
No! For cats
well
oh
Like I feel it could make your cat ill over a long period
for people?
Like it's less likely to be main cause of death over like citrus
and hahaha
i see wat u mean
hair*
sorry
ahhhh
air is poison
Yeah that's what I mean
rosemary might kill a certain bacteria INSTANTLY
¿what if hair was poison?
just perceived as being less dangerous
not less likely
wellll
I'm just saying rosemary is SLIGHTLY less likely than everything else
depends on the organism and the toxicant
after that ecotox class
I mean I know haha
but ive started seeing everything as potentially dangerous lol
certain things are like 'why would that be dangerous'
but yeah Brianna i was just playing devils advocate
hehehe

byeeee byeeee
1ug of methyl mercury u go bye ybe
everything is made of chemicals. We live in a chemical balance. Having too many of one checmical upsets the balance and makes you a dead. Everything you consume puts chemicals in your body.
Course, some things have more harmful chemicals then others.
somethings are more poison than others 😉
"The dose makes the poison" is an adage intended to indicate a basic principle of toxicology. It is credited to Paracelsus who expressed the classic toxicology maxim "All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison."
U turn orange if you eat enough carrots to die
Your death is orange
the dose makes the poison
With carrots tho
You can die from literally anything
U can die from carrots
hahah
50 pounds to die from the "poison"
but you would need to eat like
I think cashues or something have a deadly poison in them
I mean obviously when I said it's just an herb I didn't mean it's just an herb and herbs aren't dangerous
just depends on the dose
its also like
so is oxygen
water is technically toxic to humans
Lecture 1 of ecotoxicology
and literally everything is toxic to anything at a certain dose
Oh yeah haha
all im saying is everything is toxic to something
its dependant on how much they eat relative to their body mass
Yeah but it's less commonly heard over citrus and mint, at the very least maybe it's not great but not as likely to lead to death
thats also very true shon
the poison is small. The smaller you are however, porpotionetly its "more". Eating something that will do nothing to us (because the amount of poison porpotional to our size) is so little but it might make a cat sick (because its 1/5th our size) and would kill a bug (because its 1/100th our size).
This is not 100% acurate because there are other factors but thats one way of looking at things right?
well rosemary is fragrant, what your smelling is a defense against pests
Sometimes you can just tell
cats arent herbivores so no reason to evolve defenses
Yeah that's kinda what I meant by like
and haha yes shon
keeps the bugs off
most herbs are fragrant bc poison lmao
humans have evolved with consuming poison constantly

Best poison
alchohol is a poison
like nicotine is another poison
humans are super good at dealing with random poisons in shit
they talked about how toxicity is so arbitrary to whatever is ocnsuming it
it was like an extended version of this

They're perfect little mammals
a meme to brighten your day: https://i.imgur.com/A4kvfrf.jpg
But like rosemary doesn't strike me as dangerous
im searching for a relevant tumblr thing i found
I mean I know herbs are more than just herbs 😂
itss all chemachacals
different phenols
But not rosemary
tobacco
Like mint I can get a sense for why
I don't know sometimes you get why something is bad for something and sometimes you don't
so weed
herb is literally anything herbacious
Yeah but like
I feel maybe that ones really not picking
lots of things are 'just herbs'
mean
i mena
And hmm rosemary is just an herb, citrus I get but rosemary
i sent the second one she sent first image
I trust what your sister sent
that big extended list above is different than others im seeing that say that rosemary is fine
lists
some sites have different list
That's where I get all my oils
Sage is pretty good I think
yeah, im sure they sell cat safe ones!
I love my oils tho 😭😭
👍🏼
But I'm pretty sure I did that when I first got them
I'll have to look at the ingredients on my oils again
which she knew off the top of her head were bad
and then she brought up essential oils and vaping
I just said we wanna be sure and safe
Hah no
Haha did u say I'm very annoying with my cat and her health
And oooh :o
And I don't think any of my oils have these in them,,, and thankfully Kenya doesn't show any of these symptoms at all if I have accidentally used it before
they have like a vet-access-only forum/database of cases, symptoms, causes etc
Yay!
And 8O
Pppppretty sure I checked for these back in the day
also she is looking in thesuper secrete vet database today to confirm about fog machine
i had no idea though
this is the extended list

Which I barely use
Only one I have would be one that has some orange citrus stuff in it
Bc it doesnt matter if they breath it in or not, it like deposits on their fur and dust, and they lick it off when they groom

Mine are all organic mixed with tons of water
Great 😉
I looked mine up a long time ago
And yes!
She's making me feel better like the good queen she is
says my sister
there are some you should avoid
Also did you see my thing about essential oils!!!!
cozy

Hahaha exactly
like how would he know which one did him in
I saw it could be , you can kinda do it online
he had like 20 stolen electronics in his house too
yeah
No way haha he's probably too fucked to even remember what he stole
it isnt usually haha
well it can be
also pressing charges is anonymous
Oooh
i dont think the guy has the brain power for that
but housemate was scared that crackhead would get released and take revenge
Then cop went and got laptop and pressed his own charges lol
Why!!
What
Ooh shit I kinda remember this
and HE SAID NOo
and asked if my housemate wanted to press chargers
and he overheard us talking about it
and the cops came (for something else) not for that
this tear drop tattoo crackhead lying through his teeth stole my housemates laptop in second year
one thing that makes me super mad, but it worke dout anywayys
crazy shit
i think it was them
and the cops would be there like every time
and he kept coming over anyways
he has a restraining order agianst some guy
I think they got kicked out lol
but I think the people moved out
thats happened like 3 times
from someone else calling i suppose
and it either stops or i see cops
but i hover over 911 and wait
dont know if its another unit, or outside, or across the street
Oh my God
basically sounds like a woman getting domestic abused pretty badly
ive wanted to call when i hear screaming from my apartment but i never do because i have no idea where its coming from
and then again repeat the last one but in renfrew where the drunk guy fell off his bike and wasnt moving
once they checked up on a drunk dead looking guy on the ground
once they checked up on a family that was domestic abuse land
im always hesitant to call but i have 3 times and its been worth it every time
nope never
I was scared they'd get mad at me
They're assets
thats literally their purpose
they are when your crazy neighbour is off his meds and youre scared to go outside
Disagree
...
poleese are friends
So im scared to go outside :')
dont let that stop you
He lives really close
Definitely
guy needs a night in the drunk tank
yeah youve just crossed like 3 things off the list that make it 911 eligible
And I heard him screaming outside for a while afterwards
And very intoxicated
yeah so next time 911 guys
It sounds like the guy was dangerous
He called me a bitch and a cunt and stuff
boom 911
I'd say there was risk of harm with this
but if they think anyone is at risk of harm they differ you to 911
bylaw does noise complaints
311 for bylaw
Does bylaw handle that sort of thing?
Or is there a number for bylaw
and tickets
Ok then yeah 911
Ahhh
thats only like to report your car being stolen and stuff
nah non emergency line isnt ever good for in the moment stuff
I said non emergency line I think
if someone is screaming racist stuff and people are hitting each other with sticks in your lawn youve got the go ahead next time
Yeah I'm sorry I was barely conscious
I asked Nick what to do but he was half asleep and said no 😂
the guy could be off his meds or something you cant know
id call next time
that screaming is grounds enough for you to think someone is in danger
No I didn't call them
So did the cops come and remove him?
yeah 911 works
He was screaming racist shit apparently
very least
Ah I see
311 at least
public disturbance
thats 911


Some dude was on our lawn screaming all night and he wouldn't leave

I can just screenshot your messages to me
(613) 236-1222

"No, now fuck off Sue"
Why the fuck are they allowed to do this

Yeah don't but that sounds cool
but i refuse to google it for immersions sake
also he took the treasure so maybe he doesnt like heads
this one may be a different kind altogether, or just something shon made up
but thats all i know about it
and collect heads
they are super rare
who encountered one
I just heard of a friends party
But that one might be different
I didnt realise before but I think ive heard of a dnd creature called the collector, which i dont know much about
Pls gif business
He definitely scares me
mr business is kinda scary
I have a feeling that's especially accurate for Mr business
That’s like all the characters we have met so far in our DnD campaign

in their touring history the red hot chilly peppers have travelled the equivalent distance of going to the moon and back twice
Exactly
it just follows no rules
its like the mad max buss
For arriving on time
Idk why the 88 has no standards
I don't even bother trying to get the 88 going home anymore
It's so annoying
That happens to me every morning
lmao
its ALWAYS 2
:I
only to have 2 show up back to back
Ive waited outside my house for an hour
i was so mad
and nothing
i sat there for 40 mins
once though, and only once
lol same
so i evetually just went at random times and sat and hoped
since it always came at the least predictable time
i had the app but stopped using it
I used to take the 88 to work when i lived in billings
they are tied in shit teir
lol
so
while the 87 is faster, its often cancled
but
Everyone is saying the 88 is consistently the slowest god damn bus
87 follows it along most of its length
Lmao
lmao
tied only by the 87
aparently its the worst bus route in ottawa
and I keep finding threds on reddit complaing about it
lol I googled the 88

person who can find the weirdest gif by the end of the day wins
And not do it at 4am
Probably
Hahaha
i shoulda popped the screen out and stuck my head out and been like 'man you really need to grease this thing up'
although i shouldnt complain, you have a cat scream at you most nights
took 5ever to fall back asleep
woke up pretty unsettled
it was at the time
Sounds really scary
That sounds awful man
Hahaha
that is what i looked like when i woke up
<:sadshrek:591001826116239360>
someone screaming a metallic scream
and the noise bled into my dream and gave me a nightmare
i had my window open bc its hot
i think he was stocking up the pump or something
Thats not a reasonable thing to do
metal grinding and contorting
Why the hell was he out at 4am
like it was an awful noise
Jesus
it actually sounded like someone screaming
that was so squeaky and loud and terrible
was rolling around this metal contraption
Some guy at 4:00am
How so
Oh shit really?
this delivery man or someone like that ruined my night
i almost called in sick, felt so gross last nigh
im angry, this is full already

There's some random courses
slightly
slightly more marketable
heheh
similar in idea
well
Still though, basket weaving as a colage course is uh
youre right!
oh yeah
I think "Underwater Basket Weaving" is the term your looking for fin
basket weaving is literally a euphemism for a random, useless, easy course
https://www.algonquincollege.com/ccol/courses/introduction-to-shaker-style-basket-weaving/

so i was going dead north
i was trying to just go in one direction so i could go straight back
haha maybe if you tell me the coords
Are you going to make it home lol
That's perfect
Those are so hard to find
Oh hell yeah!

found millions of sea pickles
but i dont even know the coords of the base
was in pursuit of a treasure map
got loads of loot
thousands of blocks away
also btw i went super far away on the mc server
and the one in the video was "Subwoofer lullaby"
he played "Sweden"
Hahaha

Minecraft has one of the most calming soundtracks I swear
That's so cool
ive had music turned off for so long that its nostalguc for me hah

she liked little bear because little bear is lit
she watched little bear with me too B)
cuz she would watch it with me
i dont think my mom liked that episode
ooooh hahaha yeah thats really bad
like the mom wasnt mad at all
i mean if he ran into a random predator on the street
his neighbor is nice!!!
what his neighbor???
caillou is the worst show on television
child predator grabs him and bye bye
yeah they didnt even get mad at him lol
i watched the around the block one too actually
bad influence
and my parents obviously wouldnt let me act like that but I got it from the show
calliou literally made me so bad XD
lol
like he would stomp his feet and whine and i saw him doing that so I did it
but yeah youre right
i remember one being fucke d
im not sure which episode is bad but once i get there ill send you a timestamp
teach
children me included acted like calliou because the parents didnt really
a teaching moment
so when they got mad it wasnt really like
the problem wasnt that he was bad it was that his parents were too soft spoken
but the thing is calliou was bad BUT
yeah its not actually that bad
the first one is relatively accurate to children
dood
the second one he punches lol
the first one he just pinches
no he legit punches her
the very first one isnt bad
he pinches her

like him pinching her
I think in one of these he punches the baby

Maybe you and Nick could uh
<:shrekdab:586271654204932126>
Well
Oh
......
Alright I posed a public event page for it at your house saying we can have a max capacity of 1000 and that there will b live music
Hahaha sounds good to me!
wow thats a lot of time to plan
https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20190907T16&p0=188&msg=Ottawa+Shrekfest+2019&font=slab
September 7th?
Back to original point though: SHREKFEST
It's so ... Manipulative
yeah
ahhhhhh
Oh well the kiss on the head tons of people do John bossy did it once to me actually I mean the tricking girls is really shitty
but that one i dont think he understands
yeah its an invasion of personal space
But yeah that's mad shitty
like when he is drunk and happy
yeah he does it to guys even
Haha I don't think he thought anything of it Nick was right there
but bragging about tricking women is definitely intentional
like theres certain things that are definitely not intentional
yeah! you did. He does the head thing to a lot of people and I dont think he understands that its not cool
And stole my drink
It's really shitty, did I tell you dane kissed my head and whapped me in the face that time we went bar hopping?
thats literally a trap to get women who want to think youre serious about impressing them and keeping them around
thats the difference with the whole wine and couch thing
id say 90% of the time they are
Oh yeah then fuck it
if they are just looking for a quickie too then its okay
yeah if they have like feelings or aspirations its sad
That makes me sad for them
:(
but he does/did have sexual relations with less intelligent women...
Aww
a hopeless romantic
Justin is like waiting for a soulmate to come along
I only defend Justin bc I know he is different than the gross jocks
he hasnt done that in years though
and he will go in and out of it
But he like says "its british"
Plus if someone's accent was really weird to me I don't think I'd call it out either haha
still mean if they cant see through it though
really really really bad
Hahah yeah but his accent is like
Aw but that's kinda mean
like he almost wants them to call him out
Like he is aware of how bad it is like it cracks him up
Post ironic?
his is kinda like
but his is a bit different
yeah that was Justin lol
fucccck
Didn't one of them like pull a fake accent once too?
It's completely disgusting 😷
Eric and John started doing that
That's really really gross
nasty
like he would talk about his strategy to other roomates and brag about kill count and stuff
putting on this whole show
what bothered me is how fake it all was
it worked on girls though
just jock stuff
Like if a dude did that to me
That would make me hella uncomfortable
and music and wine he didnt even like
Ew
but like women he gave zero shits about
and buy an expensive bottle of wine and sit them down on the couch
and he would like clean the shit out of the nasty living room
and it was like gross john mayer and stuff
Dane literally had a playlist called like "Seduction" or something
jocks
my roomates were lame
And aw they didn't want to have it?
Halloween parties are hard to throw for some reason
bc my roomates werent supporting it, it was just me and annie inviting people
I hyped the party up and like 12 people came lol
I can't remember.. I barely remember anything haha
I think that was then
or was that another year
Steve brule?
Hmmmm
what was I
And matt and jake were bojack horseman and todd
yes!
i remember your picture together
I was like a plague victim
That was awesome
OH YEAH
He was a plague doctor
I dont remember lol
was it nick that won the cigs actually?
Ohhhhhhh did he??
Nick won first place didn't he?
Yeah!
Hahaha maybe they just wanted the cigarettes
I actually dont remember if you giuys had costumes for that one either lmao
lmao
(a pack of cigarettes)
and they abused the voting system and cory won 2nd place
it was a costume contest party
I remember my halloween party two years ago, everyone dressed up except Cory, Eric, and John 😢
Fuckboy hypebeasts
This is something the old fashioned friend group would do before they became hypebeast

Canada's first celebration of love and life
Hahahah
We'll host it on parliament hill
We need to carve our own path as Canada's first shrekfest

It's like a, go for a few days kind of thing
That too
It'a like a 16 hour drive too so it wouldn't be a weekend thing
Also Id have to get my passport before then
:(
i really really want to go to wisconsin but I dont think i can
Hahah I would love that but I wont have the time off for it
But I'm down for Ottawa shrekfest
Guys I'm down for going to Wisconsin to go to the real shrekfest
Im having trouble thinking of anyone else lmao
Nick, Brianna, Me, Annie, maybe Stacey, Matt, hopefully Shon, Jake (Matts roomate), Warren (Matts nice friend)
People who would come to Ottawa Shrekfest 2019:
hahah
It's all about the immersion
Chasing everyone destroying our own apartment
is just roaring at people who show up
thats the whole event
you and nick when people show up to shrekfest
Get out of my swamp or I'll fucking kill you
rip in peace
hahah i think he was in his swamp

CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet. You are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.
The Facebook live event hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You are now tracked on radar. You try to change your angle of ascent but you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet.
Infinite poop. You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of your butt. You have to start flushing the toilet every two minutes to keep up. You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel directly out the window. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around your house. One of the workers falls over and can't free himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles you out the window. You land in the pile. The poop accelerates. The force now propels you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at your legs. The poop ignites from their candles.
I've got a giant cut on my finger and I barely made it home last night and it was lit
<@331154975457673228> we coming soon had to mad dash for alcohol

Damn those are doing nicely
My dad's plants

But I'm always anxious the day after drinking
I got drunk rn with my dad
Just anxious from drinking the night before, Nick has it too sometimes
I get it allll the time
and does it do that?
i dont know the difference
Oh no, maybe it's from drinking last night
Shit really? Is it just anxiety or stress?
no good reason why
im really stressed for some reason
Well maybe we can still smoke it a lil bit
sounds right
"One central bud with minimal offshoots"
hemp is just a strain of cannabis sativa with low THC
its basically hemp
https://overgrowcanada.com/cannabis/seed-strains/
Oh no
hemp is cannabis
It says cannabis

make paper
Well... We could do something with it I'm sure
and always has been
which is totally legal
:I
They did say it was mainly CBD...
omg im starting to think you have hemp
Hahaha will do
Tell him I say hi and that I'm a great plant mother

Lmao
good luck with the hemp plantation
sounds good
Also going to see my dad now
I am not going to eat it lol
Eat it eat it eat it
Axels weirdly look like hemp

:|

Ahhhhhh I don't want hemp
Eat it
Food
hemp looks identical though
The leaves are slightly different
Luckily not lol
That would make alot of sense
https://dev.purduehemp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hemp-crop1-978x1024.png
It could be actually
hemp still has CBD in it
hahah omg what if it is hemp
I'm a loving mother and u have to eat your baby
maybe that company sold you hemp seeds
maybe its hemp
You have went from a loving plant mother to cannibal patent
Who are stronger than him
And yeah fin it's the weirdest looking weed plant I've seen
This will give you energy to care for your other children
Eat him
Covered in little bugs
What if it's like
Eat your weak baby Nick
If it's good enough for rabbits it's good enough for you
That's the only acceptable way
Nick eat your weed plant
it doesnt even look like weed lol

This will help my baby in the future
<:(
Like I would eat some one else's baby but not my own
irrelevant
But it wasn't me!
someone did
Water and love him
someone raised it
But!! It's different I didn't raise my potato!!
root vegetables
I've.. never mowed a lawn ever
let the plants die
same with potato
that carrot died for you
I, don't mow the lawn
when you eat a carrot
plants
many
so
kill
you
when  you mow the lawn
He's a living little lad!!
No!!
Cannabis plants
#killallmen
:)
It makes me sad!!!!
:(((( I still don't think he should die!!!!
but nooooooo
we would have had a 5 year supply of weed
NICK!!!!
all that weed became 10000 seeds
Hahaha
I HAVE NO SON
we have 10k seeds now because of his dad
No!!!!
For being male
I'm disowning him
He trusts you!
You raised him!!!
unless its a CBD one
his dad probably
one of his cousins ruined the entire crop last year
Into his dark clan
He's a plant it's so mean
He wants to assimilate the others
he wants to ruin everything and cause chaos
But!
NO!!!!
and wants to destroy other plants
he is useless
Hell provide warmth for me
NO
Noooo
I'm not gunna throw him away
you mean burn
When female life becomes too stressful
It makes me sad when you throw away plants :(
Oh damn really? Lmao
so a would-be female becomes male
what sometimes happens if the plant is stressed it can change sex
For a female
The thing on-top is too weird
at this point
you can 100% tell
No it's definitely a chad
Maybe still too young to really tell?
hmmmmmmmm
They're just kinda squishy and wet
The pods don't actually have anything inside yet
Because he's such a good boy
Strangely they seem to only like this male
Tell him no!!!
Look at the mess he made

NO!!!
And yes he is
I'll try opening a pod
Is he eating our son?????
Also ah!
I'm taking a nap in my own bed,,, it's been so long
lol
I just noticed this little guy

what happens if you break open a little pod nick
:(((
No!!!!
That's how he's going to die
Don't force him into being the Virgin incel
#burnallchads

He's a little Chad!
he will kill you first
Trying to kill him 😡
everything
ruin
he will
I'll take care of him u jerks
Hey his a Chad in his little heart

imagine if that twig knocked up your other plants
lol its just a twig

It's pretty far from being a pretty plant anyway

lol
id burn it
Wait until youre certain but yeah I would if it was male
I'll kill it

also what would you even use a male for
If its male and you dont want everything to go to seed, seperation useless isnt good enough
but just going to caution you one last time:
thats a different story entirely
if you break one open and there is a seed inside
but im thinking your right those look kinda more like male
if theres any of those little thingies coming out its female


do they have little skinny things coming out of them though?
Only at the top few leaves
My plant has these
https://www.growweedeasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/male-pollen-sacs-cannabis.jpg
but its rare

in a sec
this is a hermaphrodite:

its not as simple as ball things
watch some videos on it
Just it definitely has little ball things
thats pretty rare
... I think it's a hermaphrodite

True
Man you gotta look this kinda stuff up
the one little thin thing looks female!
Are these pollen sacks?

Have you gone through a tutorial? Or are you just guessing
are you 100% that its male?
The pollen is only at the very top of the plant so I think I caught it in time but who knows
if you want to keep the pollen i would in a seal mason jar
yeah still..
itll even get on your clothes and hands and then you touch female
I brought it inside completely
ours pollinated from like 100m away once
but being seperated isnt good enough
it may already be too late
if you are 100% about the pollen
Hahaha
Luckily I hadn't even planted him I just left him in his pot
not good enough
I removed him from the others
burn it
oh shit
I can definitely see pollen sacks on him
chunky leafed bois

you should definitely be able to tell right now though
you can do it as easy as looking closely or using magnifying glass
you should look up tutorials on sexing
it definitely could be
I cant tell if thats male or not
The other ones are doing beautifully
not a good sign
thats really really fast for flowering
shit
well shet
Damn man harassing my ladies

Oh wait is that male balls
Did my plant accidentally begin flowering


we just assume they are that colour because of the lines that go through them
our brains are constantly trying to fill in information about htings
youve been gnomed
ive been gnotted
then it worked
Ah
all the balls are the same colour
I am tricked!
I dont know
uh
r u tricked

What one?

But if you feel like "man I need more speed" then sure
It's true
If you dont feel the difference, and your perfectly fine, then your paying 10$ for nothing.
We're at 1/2 of a GB per second rn
Its kinda like
But we could double that
Well games already download within 10 minutes Jo matter what the size
Id say if you are at all getting close to the cap do it, otherwise its almost wasted?
For $70 a month

Thank you fin
I seriously thought it was a dude sniffing fucking farts directly out of shreks ass
He is smoking out of his ears
I enjoyed or very much
I don't regret anything
See my pic for my feelings
I just thought you guys could enjoy it
Nick what the fucking actual fuck
What the fuck njck
https://pics.me.me/hey-quick-question-why-are-you-making-other-people-look-35458381.png
Nick what the fuck
why
I'm really sorry

I kind of suspected around the start Bertie was probably a csa victim so I wasn't SURPRISED just kind of left wishing they would have built on it more
I didn't find it that hard to watch tho
I love speckleeeee
Spirit animal*
I feel speckle is my soul animal
I liked it more as well
Tuca and birtie is easier to relate to
but it was pretty hard to watch at times
althought bojack is a close second
not unpopular i do too
And also probably unpopular opinion....... I like it better than Bojack
But they probably had like you can have this many episodes sort of thing so they had to work with what they had as best they could
But there's definitely some story elements I wish they would have gone a little slower paced on
And idk it felt like even if there WAS a s2 I kinda like how it ended
I rewatch episodes constantly now
I loved tuca and Bertie
its  pretty open ended for one
I think there will be a s2
I can't tell if it was written to end or if there's going to be s2
i finished it
N?
Yeah.. did you finish tuca the
when he was living in the boat
Oh man yeah that was pretty bad
the daughter of his long lost love
or whatever
when he tried to screw his like daughter figure
True yeah it waa
bojack was pretty fucked
id say equal darkness
Then it turned out to be way darker
I know. At first I thought it was like a lighter bojack
It was light and then it got heavy
It got dark
Yeah...
Tuca and Bertie was sad

These gulls are evil

yes
and i didnt EAT my bugs.. just tortured them affectionately
completely different!!!!!!!!!!!
i didnt eat roots and i cried when i DIDNT eat
eating and colecting bugs
crying whne he eats
eating roots
digging in the dirt
does he not
glith now has to act like i did as a child
Classic goblins
lol
and no one knows its my fault 😃
now we have lady bugs E V E R Y W H E R E
i once let loose an entire clutch of lady bug eggs in our house
collecting bugs and shit
digging in the dirt and shit all the time
we definitely were
All children are goblins confirmed
because she kept bugging me
and i responding back *viciously* no! you can hug my back
and when britney would sleep in my bed apparently my parents would hear in the night her asking to cuddle me
*goblins*
I think children are just
and be very vicious and annoying
and refuse to have pictures taken of me
all i did was cry
because on my parents wedding day
see we were both goblins in our own right
possibly......
but wore a lot of makeup to cover it up
green skin
did she have like
*goblin*

she would sleep in my bed and roll all over and i couldnt sleep
she sounds like she was a goblin
like.. twice now that i think about it
she also threw up on me
>:I
and i could never cuddle with my cat because britney would come and bite her tail
she sounds like she uses similar tactics to goblins
my sister used to bite my cats tail while i held her and pet her and then she would get mad at me and bite and attack me
he was a physical person
oh.
I was 6, he was 4
My brother took a toy truck about half his size and slambed it over my head
it came from watching little bear
CLASSY baby

i liked *visuals*
tv*
I watched so much tb
and when the TV was on it was the histroy channel talking about WW1 and WW2
instead of TV
my mum gave me math sets
when I was a wee little tot
accidentally killing herself
in almost every home video we have im watching little bear and my sister is like
my mom watched little bear with me XD
which i was VERY! classy
this is like.. a show for classy babies
okay but this shit is CLASSY for a baby show
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YfpKSNzQ2g
all i had to do is shit my pants and get fed that shit my pants again
everyday
man
it had like classical music
I wish I was a baby
Babies
for babies
Haha most baby shows should be
but
not really for BABIES
sweet and soothing show
Lol
its surprisingly a very like
im watching it again hahaha
Oh yeah I remember this
It’s a positive
LITTLE BEAR IS CUTE

Babies r cute though
Haha jk

BUT IT WAS SO GOOD
Ur a baby

Lol

lol
https://i.imgur.com/ACn9jMm.jpg
those were literally the combos
im actually unsettled
youve been gnomed

the gnome was ill tempered
the tiefling has sexual tension with the elf druid
spike trap
died in a pit
rip dragonborn
but not like that
the dragonborne died early
had poor availability
and the gnome often didnt show up
like it spooked me
but like those 4 were IDENTICAL
thats the only difference
fairly "Standard" combos
yes
those are uh
Other then the gnome
there was a tiefling rogure, dragonborne sorcerer, elf druid, and warrior gnome
i was a half elf ranger
no sure what the chances of that are
very weird thing is i had a campaign where these were literally the four characters

Lmao

I had the door open almost eveyr day on summer nights last year
compared to renfrew or calabogiew
That'd be nice
Like
Or at least
Ahhh nice
they are not bad during the night
If its during the day yea
Do the bugs get in if you leave the doors open
And because its a fucking door it vents the apartment FAST
That's true that would be nice
you can lean out and smoke out of it
Oh true
I imagin if you smoke its great
I have used it

from your thumb to the other side of your hand
Like if you hold your hand out flat
Haha that just sounds dumb
its really fucking invonvionet
you cant put your feet forward. Your heels will hang off it
and its wide enough that if you put your feet sidewase and inftont of eachother you can stand on it
its a foot of the ground
Ours has a "ledge" too
well
they are big enough for usualy 1 person to stand on, maybe 2 pressed against eachother
to stand on
balconys have a little ledge
You know how like
Ahh lol that sucks
because its just slightyl too high
And the balcony is nice, but its akward to lean against it
Lmao
across the street
just a huge inconvionet tube
Well vent each other's air
lol yes
Let's build a tube
Lmao
Ill give you my hot air you give me your cold air
And yes I'm down
I want a balcony so damn badly
nick lets trade apartment heat
Personally I'd love to have that door balcony thing
and yes I would love basment

Ford / Lisa Tweet claim -> Kiefer complaint ->  Lisa response
Yeah Lisa is a cunt then
I shoulda sent original tweet for context
Oh I get the timeline of what happened now
Settle down lisa lol
"its harder to be a politician than to pretend to be one on TV"
i like the fact that they attacked Kiefer after he tweeted his response lmao
its so gross lol
Fuck ford
Ugh
Ugj

Yeah ok
Lmfao
Nah Ford tweeted saying that his gov is what Tommy Douglas would have wanted lol
Why is it that the only thing conservatives do is attack others

And the Conservative MP is attacking him and pissed off their grandson

Tommy douglas is the founder of the party that became the NDP
https://tenor.com/view/convince-convince-me-no-convince-me-president-snow-hunger-games-gif-13243740

Wait sorry yeah I meant to say who is Tommy lol
prominent Canadian actor, son of donald sutherland an even more prominent actor, and grandson of tommy douglas, the father of Canadian healthcare
https://tenor.com/view/kiefer-sutherland-24-yes-oh-serious-gif-12152564
Who is Kiefer Sutherland
and is an actor in a TV show which is being advertised on that bus stop
kiefer sutherland is donald sutherlands son
I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit confused as to what's going on in that bus stop picture though
Lmao
lol google reviews

they are like the even worse conservatives lol
well other than libertarian...
i just go ABC lol
thats what i do at least
Cool
Or was for provincial
Nepean is orange I think
you just walk in and say you want to vote there
Perfect
counts
yep
And live here so
Oh I do
yep
if you go to school there
Oh can I?
You can vote in Ottawa though
Im still registered in Renfrew...
Anything but conservative
if it doesnt, vote ABC, whatever is projected to do the best lol
Vote green if youre voting in a riding that has a chance
The conservatives are the skrtchiest damn party
Yeah...
which fuels the conservative majority
its really good but most of those voters are coming from liberal
Or liberal
I may vote green
I like that
looks at that green surge though
We can't deal with a conservative government right now, we need to work on the environment *now* and thats the last thing the conservatives will do
The conservatives are infinitely more corrupt
SNC wasn't even out of the normal for a pm todo
over SNC
but everyone hates the liberals
lol ford has brought him down a tiny bit
Ford could bring him dpwn
Unless scheer says something really dumb before octover
Liberals were up for a tiny bit
Understandable
For an extended duration of time
Ahhh
I get anxiety being stuck in a room though
Not as bad no
you get to just talk about what youve done
those arent bad
Fucking meetings
nice
Standup meeting
I have another meeting now lol

same
And haha smae
Nice!
Conservative majority gives me anxiety though
My anxiety wasn't AS bad during that meeting
the problem with the green party doing so well is that it vote splits with liberal and NDP
so we are probably getting a conservative majority

Less pressure to speak

It’s the same letters
Nah a firewall company

Fortnite meeting?
I hate meetings so much
Got a meeting with Fortinet at 1
Haha yeah
Aw man I feel like they'd never get back to being perfectly clean after a single use
imagine cleaning these
the little man is nasty
lol pretty crazy







Brianna has had similar issues with her loans
That's bullshit man

that they want me to pay back but i dont think i ever got
so theres 6k missing
sorry like 7k
OSAP says they have given me 13k but my school records only show ever receiving 4k
that I will need to fix
I have a big problem
so
Huh
fucking beaurocracy
sorry if you dont apply* or send them a "confirmation of enrollment" form or something like that
just takes money out of your account
Ford got rid of the 6 months grace period
like right away
also if you dont register, or send them a form saying youre still in school, it starts charging you for paying back your loans
is due sooner
yes
tuition
oh
what fees
So that's probably sooner
but like the start of fall semester
I also gotta pay fees with it
er not half way
Ok
Oh lol
but its open now
I think like half way through fall semester at some point
When's the due date for OSAP registration
I don't know tbh
Or maybe I did
do it now
I didn't file taxes last year
Fuck for real?
you cant even apply for this fall without it
lol
I can't even becauS I need my last year's tax info
but not today
i dont even know what logging into the NSLSC does but i wanted to find out
:/
thanks ontario
so i found it but its archived and unopenable

Hi Ontario yes pls help
when your security is so good that you keep out the account holder
Just casually contact your province

also
ah yeah youre right
Because there's a dropdown to choose a new question
I think you are setting them
Wtf
I apparnetly made these questions?
Im expected to know all this shit?

Fuck man
if i just provide the tax info Id get more, but problem is I need parents to have taxes
but you get only like half
Well I can opt out of ontario loans and do only federal
Are you allowed to skip it
thats why they ask both questions and offer the option to not provide info
and the ontario is 6 years
The federal portion still goes by 4 years
Or not even the poor, just anyone who's not rich
Doug Ford is attempting to lower the provincial debt by fucking over the poor
if you dont they seem fine
well if you consider debt it looks a lot worse
I have gparents that are well off, but my family is like the very low end of average
Making you a dependent just fucks the poor, and those who are behind
I can attest that as a middle-low income family i didnt receive OSAP for my first two years of school because my parents didnt have completed tax information
Who don't need loans
Just get rich parents
noone takes 6 years to do their degree
who is ever in uni while being out of highschool for 6 years??????/
wtf

I havent taken money from my parents in 2 years
Jesus Christ
He just doesn't want non rich people to go to college

I legit just hit 4 years and they still consider me a dependant
He's fucking so many people
Hes just being cheap
22 is nearly always independent
For fuck sakes
because independents get way more money
Why
What the fuck
but he changed it to 6 years as soon as I hit 4 years
With osap, after being 4 years out of highschool you used to be considered an "independent" student, and didnt have to disclose your parents tax information
What did he do now
fuck doug ford
holy fuck
Just make myself stronker
I think my upgrade is pretty simple
Oh shit true
also we have to remember to level up for tonigh
hah
So this is our racoon proof garbage can

I see
they dont even die
ghosts
now tho your sims just become like
"Common man im like 1/7th cat so I got like 2 lives left man"
be chill
like yuh bruh i fucked up set myself on fire for the 5th time but like
I've done it a lot to get out of trouble
Classic trick
Nice
just asked the grim reaper not to reap
i brought him back
but dont worry
oh no
and died 1 of the three times
my sim has caught on fire 3 times
that im playing rn
my current sims game
how do you even get caught in a fire that slow
I watched the first video
it was a horrible confession so i put it there instead
wait

you bet i fucking shooba mo wibbsy bork
https://youtu.be/GhG9j6jp_do
Briana has the language proficency: Sims
goodbye i think
that was like
i remember sul sul!
I remeber the word wormie
oh shooba wormie
I remeber doing that or something like it
you can tell the same joke to somone for 24 hours and then ask them to marry you. They will probobly say yes
Also sims:
im fucking losing it
theres spelling errors and shit
look at this!
im fucking laughing at these comments
is bringing back old memories
sims 1 video
I know I played it
Ah ok so it was 2 then

the one i remember ,,,, was sims 2 for the ps2
it was sims 2 or 3 on like xbox
one of the houses had like aliens in it
thne you could live out there or move to another one
and you had to get them to a good point and do little things
where you arived at a house that would ufcking fall apart if not for your help
there was like a "Campagin" mode
I know whatever sims games I played
back to the future or something
was that in like
oh shit i dont remember that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC4os3ne19A
sleeping tubes they just floated in
tubes
sleeping pods for beds you could get
was there like
I know I also had like, the sims 3 or somethging
they will be CARED FOR PROPERLY
and they'd be like neighbors are complaining im confiscating the child
and grab the baby
"ZOOP"
THEY LIKE
I REMEBER THAT
OH YEA
stupid social services would like fucking TELEPORT
i tried EVERYTHING
in sims three working as a crook you could get arrested
so they couldnt take them away
I removed the door on the babys room
I also remeber when social servecies came
they did not know the others life it seemed
and you'd try to make the mom sim or the dad sim take care of it and then they'd get upset and cranky and refuse to take care of the baby then social services would come and take mY BABY AWAY
and the father was working as a crook
I remeber I had the wife working as a police officer
when you had a baby and shit and it would cry
it was fucking hard
i fucking love sims
when I was a wee little lad
i have them all
remeber that
I like
NO BUT I ALSO HAVE THAT

Nick
2 degrees from the record max for today
was 31 today
supposed to only be 26 tomorrows anyways
haha true
It'll be nice for D&D haha
We have some windows open just to warm the place up
legit the only good tihng
the ONE positive thing about basements
nice 'n cool
It's really nice in the basement
u guys should come hang out in here
its probs 30 degrees in our apt still
:CCC
and we are on 4th floor
our AC is out of commission
hot
so
its
there might not be any? I dont know
I have to speak with the head desk
we have not yet
we might
Uh
Are you still getting an ac
:((((
I miss it
That fan was my salvation last year
Man
I see
And Targ is a pinball and old arcade machine bar
Our basement is really cool right now haha
Oh noo
So no I have nothing for the summer 😦
And it broke last week
I had a 20$ fan to keep me cool
It’s too hot
Also
What is this targ
Damnit lol
Ahhhh haha
Except it's too addicting
Nicotine is the only drug that's nice to me
Although I haven't had any desire to do them for like a year
Hahahaha yeah I'm basically the same except somehow I've willed myself into liking shrooms again
My body - Caffeine: Nope, Alcohol: Okay for a bit, Weed: time for panic attack, Shrooms: be existential and sad for 6 months
Also cutting down caffeine because that also makes my anxiety bad
Also same
Same
Ahh yeah hah
But can't deal with the effects on weekdays with this job
Wish my body didn’t hate everything
Yeah on weekends it's alright if I'm a bit anxious the next day. Generally I don't even feel it as much
But I think weekend pints are mostly fine
I don’t think I’m addicted at all but I think it’s had a bit of a negative effect on anxiety and work
Mornings would be hell
Holy fuck lol
Sawyers dad drinks like a 6 pack every day after school lol
But not sure it’s a healthy reward system
The cravings suck
Yeah...
Yeah
And then I just crave getting off and grabbing a pint
It really sucks because I like after work beers
Me too man
At work at least
It’s usually social anxiety fretting over whatever I said for the past few hours
And next day is bad for me
Yep! It really sucks
Idk why
After drinking a few when I sober up I get real bad anxiety
Oh geez really? I’ve sorta noticed the same man!
Haha same
Yes that sounds good to me. I'm trying to avoid drinking on weekdays at all now because of anxiety
I still want to drink but I feel like is given me some anxiety
Or something along those lines idk lol
I feel like that’s healthy
Nick are we limiting ourselves to 4 beers a week at most on two occasions?
And I had a dream I ran into you at a bar <@!136253782131474432>
Sad that that even needs to happen though
Ahhhh yeah. Well it’s more common that it should be for sure, but saying that it’s okay because it’s common is bad. I’ve seen it before where women have leaned in and shouted at a guy over that and makes a whole scene in public, which is good and embarrass the shit out of them
And Stacey and her friend are just like that's what happens 🤪🤪🤪🤪
And like touched my chest actually everyone was fucking doing that which I hATED and then people kept grabbing and holding me by the hips so I couldn't easily slip out of it
Some one grabbed my face and kept telling me how cute I was
Once a month
I’m not sure! But it’s usually on Facebook
When is that night?
Oh damn that sounds awesome!
Instead of like drake
All stuff you actually know and enjoy
The killers lol
Like franz Ferdinand take me out
It’s all like alt rock and less popular dance music
Is the name of the night
Friday I’m in love
They do one night a month that is awesome music
Oh! Yeah I wanna check that out
<@257986741896609802> might even like Targ
Also 27 club was really fun last weekend
Haha yeah that’d be sweet!
Yeah same
Speaking of which, we should go to Targ soon
With some friends
At most
I just like a slightly crowded bar
Yeah I don't really like clubs because of that
But common in dark dingey clubs where people think they can get away with it
Yeah it's nasty
It’s disgusting
Or grabbed their balls and twisted
Ahhh yeah. Annie has said she had had that happen in Vancouver. Someone squeezed her butt. (Last year) she said now she would have clocked them if it happened again
It was at the pump
I wasn't there
She got hit on a lot and touched and stuff
Also haha hope your dad had a fun time <@!296572507241054209>
What happened at the pub?
Another time theb
Aw damn
I’m in renfrew :/
<@331154975457673228> wanna walk around Ottawa today
I hate going to bars and clubs forever now bye
He got very drunk
And well lemme tell u
So! It was my dad's birthday today!
Should be good from here on out though
They do that when not enough light early on
Haha yeah just a bit of stretching
My plants doing well but it's a bit weird ...


Holy crap

I can show before 5:00 but yea
Put them in a super hot climate so it'll be like RPing
I have to swealter in the heat
Oh no that's right
I have to sit at home to do DnD
Our basement is pretty cool if you ever just want to cool down
nooooooooooo
It's going to be 28 on Sunday 😎
not one bit
I do not like this
it makes me hot
I am not good with heat
I need a fan
holy fuck its starting to get hot
<@331154975457673228> is your BBQ thing going until after work? You want to do something after?
I love everything that goes on

Fucking downtown Ottawa
Hahaha
Cow milking competition

yep
Haha well at least you got it out
lol
i excavated it with a thumb tack
Which hurt so much
Biting just shoved it deeper
Bite at it
I’m angry
Christ
Hurts a lot
Yes
After getting hair cut
Does it hurt
I woke up like that
How is that even possible
Oh man what

Oh Jesus how
a hair lodged itself deep under my nail
fucking hell
lol
It won't let me turn off that one kind of notif
Nice I changed all of them fine except the only one I wanted to turn off

Oh I gotta look into that
you can change notification settings
i tihnk you can turn off theose though
Oh no not work dreams
very true i basically ignore notifications now
yeah
and hahah
had a dream i was explaining sql queries to someone
It used to actually be relevant
Like people who I barely know posting
I always login to like 40 notifications and it's always irrelevant shit
I like how FB changed notifications to be basically useless
lol
Oh dope I haven't been on FB in forever lol
that you should be invited to on fb
I have my party next weekend

Is next weekend good?
Lol
Weekend 100% lol
Weekday or weekend

poisons with lily of valley
Apparently I hear that's good stuff
lol
Fruit loops
Context
Can I have


lol
I wish I knew that my last million grows haha
only possible to overwater across many waterings being too close together
not possible to 'overwater' during one watering, when you have a hole in the bottom
They should grow a lot better this time
nice
Yep!
you doing flood and dry this time?
I didn't want them interfering with each other
The white one
oh no
I pulled the one put haha
probably my bad
hahah nice
So lol it happened

Im not an artist myself, but you guys will still see plenty of shity hand drawn sketches from myself :p
References
Plus never forget:
I have barely and idea and it changes as I draw it haha
Its not wrong. That is all there is. Just knowing what to do where, and having vision is hard.
ANYWAY sorry Finn
Drawing is literally straight line curved line
Like
That is actually very very solid advice
as your work shows
course practice and training help a hell of a lot
"If you can draw a strait line, and a curved line, you can draw anything"
My mum always said to me
nice
There you can see him better
looks pretty good

its good
Its good!
but its not shit
He's shy!
he is covering his nipples
That's shit
Wait
its better then what I can draw

if it has a strait line
hell
its better then when I can draw
If it has a curved line
Also what does truth do shon
Just lines rn
Like it's shiiiiiit
Yes
hah sure
Ive got a shitty Gwyn sketched out wanna see
I wanna do everyone
I want to!!!!!
mine
you dont have to prioritise mien
but no pressure or anything like id be fine without
If I complete it
I wanna get them printed
sounds like a really cool idea
Just for funnnnn
I wanna base it off tarot cards I think
Yeah!!!
would be a pretty fun thing probably
but as an art project of course you can!
I dont have any special ideas for him
its really up to you
but I dont require one
I wanna make one for all of us
like if you want to!
but you dont have to
Like as a little card
I mean you can
Uhhhhhhhh
Would u like me to draw ur character :D
I wabna know
sorry to interrupt
<@!331154975457673228>
42
and ascend to a new plane of existence
you learn the meaning of the universe
It is the most powerful card in the deck.
**Truth**
The ace of diamonds has no description, it simply states one word:
so you can wish for more wishes
i want to test if you have 52 things memorised
A wish that could do ANYTHING at all
whats 5 of clubs do
even greater then a wish
The most powerful card the deck could give you
Ace of Diamonds
There is a single card in the deck
I will say this
B)
GOOD reason
*a e s t h e t i c*
the
i just want it for
that can kill you, make you wish you died, or grant you massive boons and riches
im not gonna lie
its an INCREADIBLY powerful artifact
at some point
you will probobly hear of it
but yes
in its making
The deck was more so delerberate
one of my favourite cards

sexy sexy symbolism
like death doesnt mean your going to DIE its symbolic more of change like your making a very drastic change in your life there for it is the death of something in your life but its not literal just UGHHHH
the cards that seem bad never actually mean bad bad
ALSO with tarot
the one based on ttttaaaaaarottttttt ❤
and whats the original like
thats neat 😮
with 1/4 being good, 1/4 being bad, 1/4 being HORRIBLE, 1/4 being GREAT, and 2 (joker) being netreal.
.. i gotta sage them again
i should bring down my deck from home
with sexy sexy art
sexy sexy symbolism
with GREAT symbolism
tarot has really nice cards
Yep
its 52.
rather then like 12 or so
oh like hearts and clubs and what not
52 cards.
I based it on a normal deck
ooh haha
Rather then terot
I changed it a little
but
i mean its still cool
Its based on them
thats nothing like tarot at all 😦
.......
There are a decent amount of cards.
When you go to draw from it, you have to say how many cards you want to draw. 1, 5, 12, whatever. You then must draw that many cards from it. Each card can range from giving you 50,000 gold worth of gems, give you 3 wishes, imprison your soul in a plane of hell, fight DEATH ITSELF, or flip your alienment and randomize your class.
he doesnt have anything fun about him
maybe gwin
or,,,

i never skip it
I LOVE THE INTRO
why do i love the intro so much
the noise he made
I didn't like it until this happened
This is why I kept watching

It made me laugh like genuinely laugh the first time I saw it
I love the part with tuca walking down the street
I loved the sex bugs lol
I'm going to be the coolest kid in my class
"Medic!"
"SMOOTHIES"
"Juicing"

sex bugs
It's such a good show
Nicee

Just sitting there as if still used
There's just floppy disks on my coworkers desk

That's terrifying
but not a baby
yes lol
Bad
HHHHHH
Trainspotting style?
saw a woman hanging from his ceiling
nathan had that a month or two ago
thats really shitty
It suckeddddd
That sounds like a horror movie
its fucking terrefying
Yea I had something like that once before
I might have mostly been dreaming but I couldn't move and I couldn't wake up
Jesus Christ
Like my door slamming and like shadow things shooting all over the floor
Couldn't move and kept seeing shit
oh shit what happend?
Oh holy fuck I just remembered I had the worst sleep paralysis of my life today 🙂
Hahaha same
me at work all the time

I know I like that it's so accurate though
like when the HR person was like "he was probably trying to compliment you"
it kinda stresses me out
I love tuca and Bertie sO MUCH
Hahaha
"be a good boy and eat your gamby"
just the first ep
Are you watching it?
Hahahahaha yes she tried to find that scene on YouTube to link it but couldn't!
about watering your weed plant with alchol
this is where brianna got that joke

It looks good
I saw the trailer for it
Ooooh vapour wave

Lol
Hopefully you don't have a hard time sleeping for real now
Hahaha

A bunch of people hopped off when he said it

Bus drivers saying to get your proof of payment and shit because they're going to get on

O

no worries if you wanna keep seperate hehe
thoughts on having matt on this server?
yes
@everyone ready for tonight? 😄
i annoyed my friends mostly 😆
very fair reaction
it got followed up with me getting the shit beat out of me
but would........ nya
like i would never scream it
... no
Enough to cause so much proximity cringe
i grew out of it but i was definitely this annoying
honestly though i was bad like this as a kid
oh 2013
this has 2010 vibes
if i was in line with these people
i would kill myself
OH my god
https://youtu.be/85y-N5GJa9g
correction 14
i used to watch this like 10 times a day when i was like 12
violent anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arzryKA9Cak
it sounds cringy
oh my god
Some anime convention or something
“Nyyaaa!”
and what 😮 NO
they dont treat you like a person they treat you like a character
Did I send you the nyaaa meme
Ahhh
when i was in cosplay
i had a dude who smelled really bad like put his arm around me for a picture once

Pls gif furry
yeah thats a huge problem at cons
Just randomly wanted a hug?
furry dragon dog tried to hug me
and this fucking....
it was my first time ever at a convention
one tried to hug me once and i was absolutely horrified
some furries have interpreters because they refuse to break character and speak too
its horrifying
is when the suit has it rigged up so when the person talks or whatever the suit moves
okay but you know whats bad
no tho yen was a furry and she was gay too i swear like the majority of them are
yes ❤
beastiality but with consent
but like a ton of furries are also gay
Its a marginalised sexual group i guess lmao
i dont know why
lgbtq whatever the fuck go hand in hand
LGTBQA*F*
okay furries and like
also why does it have a pride flag
all this stuff is so sexual
it is higher quality then it has ANY right to be
do one of the furries have a licence to fly????
where did they get the money to pay a person to fly them up to get this shot
where did these furries get a plane
they have a shot they only could have gotten with a helicopter or plane
is a person in a suit walking around abandoned buildings to shitty pop music
it has PRODUCTION VALUE
this is awful
I dont want youtube to think i like this type of stuff now
walking around in a fucking dog costume
in a post apocalyptic setting fucking
its a fucking furry
okay this one is actually hilarious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21IWc58VPmE
lol
hOLY SHIT THERES SO MANY OF THESE
okay but this costume is incredibly high quality to be fair
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFwFrcLiEuU
thats why
honestly though theyre the cringiest of the bunch
singled out
furries are just kinda
but really any convention has its CANCER
so its hilarious
like shit like this happens all the time its just rainfurrest was sensationalized and also its furries
theyve since been completely banned from any convention ever
still they cannot walk
like
they cannot walk
thats fucked
shattered.
PELVIS
THEIR
DESTROYED
and COMPLETELY
terrible
the thin part
not with the paddle side of the paddle but like the side part
and HIT THEM AT FULL FORCE
and they got a RUNNING. START.
someone saw someone in a cosplay of a character they liked
lol
AND ONE TIME
and it was COMPLETELY SEXUAL
ON THE ASS WITH THEM
HARD
AND ACTUALLY HIT PEOPLE
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE BECAUSE PEOPLE WOUKLD TAKE THESE PADDLES

IN 2006
BUT NO YAOI PADDLES
also i think i remember watching something on shrekfest about it
i felt it in my shrek soul
HOW DID YOU KNOW
and YES
sororities do paddels
is that shrek vr
also
called yaoi paddles
were a thing


these

Agreed
like one time
it just immediately becomes pure cancer
these PEOPLE can be awful like its just people who take video games and fandoms and shit too seriously
True
in general can be really awful
cosplayers**
cosplays
i wouldnt be surprised just because people hate furries so much but like
but idk
a few bad apples intentionaly trying to ruin it for bad plublisity
I heard that the rainfurrest thing was like
ive seen worse
but
furries are bad
like ive been in this whole kind of like uuuh thing for a long time and lemme tell u
which i was one
but i mean what can you shrexpect
like.. homestucks
truthfully rainfurrest was sensationalized but honestly ANY cosplayer can be awful
A lot of them are assholes, just like anyone else
but rainfurrest was a disaster
i have a soft spot for furries
yes
yes
rainfurrest
when they ruined the hotel
have you seen that video on the furry convention
and i was also 14 when i drew this
i want to be clear i am not a furry
the furry art i did for yen
not my thing
https://www.deviantart.com/tacosryummy/art/Yenenda-s-fursona-070-326545060
but like for real hold on
i just like fluttershy
oh my god no
my ds is covered in mlp stickers
but not in a sexual way
i.. like my little pony
i used to draw furry art for her
and brandon parent and zach pudsey level
like Bronies
yen was actually a furry
but it being your entire life is a bit different
haha yeah thats fine
ill be wearing my cat ears proudly !
bc they arent as serious about it lol
WELL!
I prefer the shrek crowd

curious
like honestly im not even really going with the intention of being a jerk im just....
like imagine what we will experiance
no one wants to come
I hope you guys have a fun time
but thanks for the offer
hahahah

THATS HOW I KNEW ABOUT IT
WHAT
like she TOLD me about it
yes
NO way
madison wisconsin
but its literally in the city we went to visit
ah damn

but she was never really that into memes
hahah yes
because like i genuinely wanted to go back when i went to wisconsin when i met yen

So much wreckage
so many lives lost
i would breed 128 every 20 mins
pittance
We only got 960 chickens

depspawned
we coucldnt even pick up 1/10th of the drops
The one single scream from each chicken as they were killed was horrifyingly sweet
yeah probably
2000 of them
also how many of the 2026 chickens do you think were from that farm
ahh hahaha
you get like 2 chickens per 16
I was using the eggs as I got them
nah
You have to destroy the eggs!
There's enough eggs for 5x the amount of chickens from before
IT WILL BEGIN AGAIN
I'm going to burn them all
OR ELSE
TAKE THE EGGS FROM FIN
GET THE EGGS
WAIT NICK

Oh my God Finn is in that pile
I feel like whatever findlay is doing in that corner is highly ilegeal in 47 states
not sure why
lol i was dying in there
the chickens told me to do it
findlay my god

im currenlty still bredding them
this will happen again
or else...
there cant be even 2 left
we have to kill all the chickens
yes
uh is that fixable
talented cyber-attackers
The chickens are smart
Stack buffer overflow can be caused deliberately as part of an attack known as stack smashing. I
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow
hahah i was breeding them when it happened
you farmed enough chickens that you caused a stack overflow error

touch one block and they all explode
server died again
then watch as the land is cursed
toh fuck
I don't think
change all chickens to silverfish
Hahaha not in vanilla
Is there a command to change a mob from one type to another?


Remove the gate around the puffer fish and maybe they can kill some chickens for u
you will fear... Cluk
How's the puffer fish

for a chicken boss fight
I curse you
They will haunt you
Your... chickens
Fin
They're not supposed to be in there
And yes please get them out of the house
Ruby because she is red
Also did you see your chickens

Hahaha yeah what to
And change my sheep's name for me?
Okay so can u go to my house

Also Nick can u do me a favour
The hive has been released

I think the chickens won
I think TNT

Fire spreads And it's chaos is hard to control we need some careful planning

I think I might need to expand the pen
adam and eve chickens
they probably all came from 2 common acestors
you have to put an end to this war crime
fin no



it manfested as physical pain instead
He did not show his emotional pain from his obsession with jimmy
I think that was turly his ilness.
has alwasy thought he was the root of all his problems
he didnt trust jimmy one bit though
yep
He tried to lie to himself "I never cared about you" yet everything he did was because of jimmy
His obsession with jimmy corrolates with his illness.
yeah and its not like he was just an 'evil person' for no reason
it was still saddening to see him lose himsefl over the mental illness
its a tragic story of how it got to be so bad though
As much as a sub-human as chuck was
and was saddened by it
I *knew* what was going to happen
The title: Lantren. The intro; the defening lantren.
the thudding noise
I was in disbelief
When I saw the intro I knew
that ending...
oh youre tied with me now
I watched the season 3 final of BCS
Also
whaty ou have done
disgusting
walking around once in there gets your a large chest worth of eggs
haha yes
I went from 7 to 42 exp from breeding them like twice
We need to oppen up los pollos hermanos
the great chicken purge
a fair swath of land was burned
oh shit
the iron golem escaped
Hahahaha holy shit

you all should @everyone
just to see the new farm
<@!136253782131474432>  you should join the server for a few minutes
Absolutely I can

can you hold 64  1 x 1 m chunks of stone in your hand
But it'd be hard to hold more than 16 eggs in your hands
Me too
Yeah
i wish eggs stakced to 64
yep 😦
They were going to get clean :(
Idk how you can do that to a person
It was awful
he literally watched her choking to death
Yeah that was no mistake
he could have saved her but choose not to
And she fell onto her back
He was shaking Jessie
he watched her choke to death
Well
Oh I know
it wasnt a mistake

Was that club 27 you were at yesterday fin
By mistake but if he wasn't there it wouldn't have happened
Walter did
He pushed her on her back
Yeah ...
jesses gf
Fuck I'm on the saddest breaking bad' episode

They said when they roll out first it will only be pre-built, and they plan to add features as they expend out of the beta.
imagine how much storage it will take to geolocate everyones structures
2b2t
Yep
anarchy server
to the public
that way the world wont be filled with peni
thats pretty cool
From what I have heard from their blog, you can place pre-built stuff for anyone to see, but you and your friends can make and see eachothers custom stuff
problem is you cant nerdpole
hopefully you can fully built houses around yourself
Im thinking it will be nice. At least of AR game concepts, its a good one
outside placing like prebuilt shit
itll likely have 0 functionality
for the sake of getting into the AR scene
cheeky laggy phone game
also lol i think itll be a let-down
I'll update the server
Yes!
we should all play sometime bc we can loot that temple
I'm kinda excited

Yea. I know I just cant do a job that involves standing for more then 2 hours at a time. That kicks out a lot of minimum wage jobs
i think shons farm partially burned down
where you get a lil ODSB and work something part time
sometimes its a combo
its quite possible they can find you some jobs that will accomodate it, but if not then you get ODSB at the very least
theyll set you up with whatever works best for you
if I quallify for it or not, and give documentation
thats good!
Thats what they are going to fuger out
you can also be covered by ODSB if its bad enough to stop you from working
Yep heal spurs
if you show its an acceessibility requirement
Makes it illegal for you to get reprisal from it
yeah, the heal spurs?
get documentation and stuff on it
thats good
Employment ontario
They have me going to a doc to get my foot looked at

Ontario Work's has covered us for the short time being.
Both of us are looking for work. We have been pinching pennies for the past little while as we look.
Like where does he work
What does tyler do :O
Admitidly however, I am very uh... strict with money.
Rather then wait till the end of the week/month to make sure we have money left over, he would rather spend most of his savings on a pizza the day he gets money.
Tyer likes to buy tings on impuls
Get the most bang for my buck
but for the most part, I spend my money on Efficency
noice
Eh sometimes. Maybe if there is a good sale
do you guys eat any meat
wow
The 40$ of pasta I got should last me and tyler at least 2 weeks, possibly 3.
3 days.
3.
how many meals does $25 get
how long does it last him
yeah geez
the mod sorry
an abomination he force feads himself
I call it a wast of 25$
He loves it

He.... Wants little niddle
Yea I had to pick it up. He ends up paying for it
It is. Gotta make it last the month.

He has to be the worst sibling
He deserves nothing but the worst

LARGE
realistically its like 4 large bowls of rice
like rice makes you feel pretty full
i dont think i could even
jesus christ
like 8 of these

one large bag of rice
because i cant imagine what a kilogram and a half of rice is is that just like basically
how much is that visually
okay so
turns out you need to eat a kilogram and a half of plain cooked rice in order to get your daily calories
because now she makes the majority of her money using youtube
she started cooking and making videos and i guess slowly built up her audience
she somehow got out of it though
crazy rollercosater
oh wow
tHEN she was homeless and lived under a bridge
THEN they were super poor so then she had to go and live in the city to work and make money for them
apparently her mom left when she was young she was abused by her step mom when he dad wasnt around and then her dad died and she went to live with her grandparents
holy shit this girl has a sad fucking back story
she has a little lamb that follows her around everywhere
go through the whole winter with spicy veggies and bean paste

gross
In the command line or in a script you'll have to escape the spaces with a backslash before them
Not from the command line
but probably bad practise
Spaces are fine in file paths eh?
makes you make the path yourself by combining them
Ive asked the same question many times
folder, sure, but why not file
why cant you copy path to a file on windows
yeah lol
Trudea is going to be bringing up the abortion issues in the USA with Mike today

Also ive been watching better call saul
Oh yeah
thats how I'd imagin it works
ass-blasting you with radio waves
then I bet they are just like
If it just kills your signal
https://tenor.com/view/iam-confusion-gif-10525591
did you lose signal
i am confusion, america please explain
Yeah big huge antennas on the cars at the front
and I dont know how youd do that without causing chaos
or its like a mini emp
so you cant make calls
would have to jam your signal
It either like
as in your phone is jammed if youre nearby?
wait wat
?
just bombard the area with random radio waves (in the frequency of cell phones)
how do one of those work?
They had cell phone jammers on some of the cars
chaos
all of them have the same control 1 has
they have the councle of presidents
eveyr 4 years a new one is added
until the day you die you were president
you could never leave it
once you became president
what if like
I guess it's more like a title
just not always THE president
once youre a president, youre always a president
hum
they call all previous presidents president there
but he is not
he was pres
I mean
not be valled president?
!!!!!!
shouldnt he like
http://www.canadiantirecentre.com/event/a-conversation-with-barack-obama/

Glen who I used to work with found some snails in lettuce once
😍😍

PUB DE GASTRO
It makes me think of the French for some reason
I think its because gastropods
lol
A gassy pub
Makes me think of gas
makes me think of a snail
also the word gastropub is nasty
being disreputable
Haha what makes a dive bar a dive bar?
I would believe that it was one at some point
a real speakeasy
But yeah dive bars are trendy
Yeah the glue pot was real
but the gluepot was genuinely nasty
they just want to seem divey
they arent actually divey
most dive bars are like posers
And they have a 4 dollar lager :0 holy shit
Hahaha I want to go there
My goblin would do no such thing!!!
$4
told you about the Pour Boy lager
I went there a couple weeks ago
Hahha if yo ugoogle dive bar you get Pour Boy
And probably it's downtown realestate
The goblin would drink at the glue pot and then harass the ladies upstairs at carbellos
probably a shit ton
i wonder how much money he got for selling
its where goblins would drink if we had any
Hahaha yeah there couldn't have been a better name
That's so gross hahaha
lol even the name "Glue pot" hahah
but that sure seems to fit
lol i hadnt heard of the term dive bar
Two separate places same building
And a dive bar
Wait so that nasty place was also a strip club
Lmfao
— while most of the 30 or so dancers will move to the Bare Fax in the ByWard Market
Classy placr
I thought barefax was the only Ottawa strip club
In June 2015, two Barbarella’s employees were charged with aggravated assault following an attack on an Uber driver, and in January 2017, a male employee was stabbed outside the club, following an altercation that began inside.
Lmao of course it is
the cabaret is a strip club lol
Apparently that's what it used to be

https://ottawacitizen.com/business/local-business/a-nice-dive-glue-pot-pub-set-to-say-goodbye
The green is classic
Haha yeah there's no point
why battle it? they dont clean the statue of liberty
and its like 2 years later and they are already turning torquois

Looks its literally the supreme court, east block of parliament, some nice parks, some nice turquois buildings, and then GLUE POT

dancing isnt it
Hahaha what even is that
VIP

The last of its kind downtown
Yeah
it literally looks like industrial era buildin
lol
I wonder if they'll keep the right side of the building
Lmao I'm kind of sad because it's an icon. Like exactly, you knew what I meant
I like how I knew what you meant by "nasty bar downtown"
Well on the process of being torn down
And yeah the entire left side of the building is torn down
different spot
Haha holy shit it's just a hole

Glue pot

oh geez was it where this hole is

looks like its from the 1930s
lol
Yes

The one in that super old worn down building
They're tearing down that nasty bar beside the parking lot downtown
True they shouldn't care as possessions don'ta matter

Shoulda hit her with the السلام معكم يا سيدتي
If you like
I think it would be really funny
pretty much the same thing but jewish
hebrew
What's shalom again
greeting in Arabic that means "Peace be upon you". The salaam is a religious salutation among Muslims when greeting
what if she was a really open minded lady and wanted to hear more about talos
alternatively to scare her I coulda given her an ol "A salam alaikum"
fuck i wish i wasnt so off guard i would have done that
hahhah
All hail talos ma'am
By the nine
and yeah what a jerk
i shoulda said something "why thank you, may the *gods* be with you too"
a woman told me "may god be with you young man" the other week
I told him his dog was cute and he was just like yeah.
lol
It isn't too bad

I don't have enough to pay off my cc
It sucks though
Yeaah
and i get paid two days later
ahhh
And I started Wednesday
That makes sense I think. You started on the Monday before me
on thursday
im getting paid for 1 and a half
:/
Only got paid for one week :(

It’s like the most dramatic thing I know lmao
Hah, perhaps. Need to find a good fit for it if it where used.
Sound track for boss fight in DnD lmao
https://youtu.be/KgEKmr0SZrw
Also <@!257986741896609802>
Normally mine are 1st person
It was a 3rd person dream too
obviously horrifying
Lol
that sounds like.. a vaporwave music video
Interesting
Pretty much. Also when the cubes were really bad the shape was just a disparate cloud
like i imagine like a vague manshape set of cubes in like a windows movie maker esque kind of forest backround running in space
thats so like..
jesus christ
So my cubes kept separating and flying apart
Massive fever and headache
Thing is, this bad feeling was really really really bad in real life
But when I kept them tight I felt better
And the further apart they got, the worse I felt
But I couldn’t keep my cubes together
And I was running through the forest, or rather my loosely connected cloud of cubes was
And dreamt that I was made up of a bunch of tiny cubes
I had a bad fever a few months ago
Also <@!257986741896609802> semi related sorta to grid dreams haha
Jolts
jokes awake
but that little stumble would send me into like YOUR FALLING
Classic
Lol
where i was walking on a sidewalk and like i just kinda stumbled a little tiny bit
every single time
and i had this reocurring dream
i used to fall asleep in class all the time
this is really funny
oh shit actually
oh cool 😮
Like in a classroom or whatever
If it for some reason thinks you fell asleep unprepared
So it’s your mind waking you up before you fall asleep and fall to your death
Nook
Or be in a tight book
It’s important to have a good grip first
And would fall asleep among the branches
Is from when we were tree faring primates
But the reason *why*
That’s *how* you get that
Oh but yes sorry
The theory at least
I see
Nah that’s a primal thing
falling sensation sometimes?
is that why u get the uhhhh
Constant speed
That’s why we can’t feel the rotation of the earth lol
It actually can’t detect movement, just acceleration
And is as susceptible to hallucinations and dreaming as any other sense
Your inner ear tracks movement and acceleration “zooming” or rocking or what not, and is technically a sense, just like sight
I wouldnyt say its like alice in wonderlad thingy. The world itself does not change. Just the grid. Just the scale.
You’ve explained it pretty well
I have these two dreams every few months or so. I can never explain them propery.
and see the grid if I start to pass out
I feel the zooming sensation
but when I close my eyes
walk around
wake up
like
is I can be fully concious
another thing about the grid dream
im usualy still recovering from zoomies when it kicks in
Thats the "other" dream
Yikes
your hands, your desk, your cat
Now imagin that; but instead of a painting its like, reality
All of it gets thicker and thicker until you only see a black painting
So does the painting just go full black
And as more ink is added to the painting, its gets slopy; little spikes and stuff come off instead of being smooth lines
parasite dreams is the best way to describe awful recurring dreams
But the lines are all black. Its ink.
So the eyes, puples, lips, fingers, nails, everything. Every line got thicker
Which line wins
every single one.
Ahhh I know what you mean about parasite dreams
Imagin if every single line on the painting stated to get thicker
Imagin you look at a painting
The Alice in wonderland thing I had for like fleeting seconds on shrooms but his one time in grade 2 is lasted for like 45 mins
but like
The whole outline thing is like different, but it always come with this dream. Like a parasite dream that attaches on, I never have one without the other
that's crazy
Nothing in the world changes. only the grid. So the scale of the world changes
No, for the grid is getting bigger. More zoomed in.
so I can only percive the grid as growing
Or are you growing
but the grid is constant
as if EVERYTHING is shrinking
the scale of the world is changing rapidly
Oh god
I get the motion of "zooming" forward through said graid
Until everything turns black
the world remains the same
the grid expands
Its like
I've had that on lsd
How do you zoom in on it without anything changing
that grids everything in the world
like a cuboid grid
like im inside the grid
a 3d grid
like
What grid
Oh boy shon
I get this dream every 2-3 months. Im always in my room or something in said dream
instant hate
freaked me out so bad
until all I can see is black
i got exactly that when i did shrooms
also all the "outline" on everything get thicker and spiky
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_syndrome
but the world around me does not change
as if im "zooming in" on it
but the grid keeps getting bigger
I can concive this grid
where everything is in a 3d grid
I sometimes have a dream
its like well i guess this is your life now
high**
when your suddenly fucked up but ur not hight
i hate stuff like that
like thats really scary
Haha yeah I was definitely weirded out
on the floor
i know if that happened to me i'd be like
i mean that can definately CAUSE some pretty bad anxiety
But I don’t think it was that bad because it wasn’t linked to anxiety
that sounds awful
oh my god
I think I freaked him out
“Everything is farther away”
I asked the teacher what was going on and he didn’t know
Like looking through the wrong end of binoculars
It was kinda like everything was farther away and clearer than they should have been
But you’re aware of it
Where your surroundings don’t seem real
Derealisation
And it was a kind of dissociation called derealisatiom
Weirdest thing I ever had not on drugs was when I was in grade 2 or 3
Nasty business
is it a STROKE
im like is this a panic attack
Yeah for sure
gonna have to go to the hospital
i was scared af tho thought i was like
Nasty either way
i honestly dont know what it was
i had a bad day yesterday
Sounds a bit like head rush with the vision thing which happens when brain is deprived of oxygen, which can be from bad breathing during bad anxiety
Jeez
*someone calls my name*

Me, to the fuzzy land of disassociation I’m stuck in: oh shit that’s me guys, gotta go
its LITERALLY like shrooms
this was like breathing
and like i was seeing splotches of red and black everywhere
like it was bad enough that i was so stressed and freaked out the edges of my vision was all black and blurry
REAAAALLLY bad

Baaaad feeling
I had it on shrooms a bit
Ohno
i disassociated for the first time ever in my life and lemme tell u all those memes dont do it justice
hahahahaha yeah mostly it started like i was nervous about going to the doctor then i got sad then i went home and that stressed me out and then i was just on the ride home like WOW!!!!
rip, I can't find any images for that. try something else.

I'll be tired and have a headache
I usually have 2 mediums at work
i usually drink an iced tea and its perfect level
what if you drink none
Hahaha
I only need one in the morning
2.5 more than i can handle
I have like three medium coffees a day usually
No actually at this time my tolerance isn't that high lol
do you feel like a zombie if you dont drink any
Niiiick
I'm going to go out with a heart attack for surr
youre on some next level tolerance
:I
Also the pills I used to take were mixed with caffeine so I've probably done close to 1kmg before
I've had 500mg of caffeine in a couple of hours before
I drank one and a haaalf(?) Maybe and my heart started beating so fast I was scared I'd have a heart attack
Like coffee is at least like kinda natural but there is NOTHING natural about what monster does to you
Those are evil
No u know what I really can't do is monsters
I crave the *death*
all the flavor with none of the death
It's like this is okay
That's like drinking alcohol free beer
Nahhhh
decaf baby
That shit delicious
But u know what
Caffeine sometimes gives me hella anxiety
i cant do a full medium coffee, that man is a trooper
Boy needs to get good
Hahaha aww he sounds weak to caffeine

His second caffeinated thing of the day apparently
He actually only had a medium cappuccino

And kinda seemed like he was having a hard time talking all of a sudden
He got quiet and just said he drank too much caffeine
oh no
Accidentally assisted a coworker overdo himself on caffeine
look its me and kenya

The English word "pederasty" in present-day usage might imply the abuse of minors in certain jurisdictions, but Athenian law, for instance, recognized consent but not age as a factor in regulating sexual behavior.

Alright
I just know sometime between now and 6
No idea when he is back

<@!136253782131474432>
Unless your leaving with him then he will obviously know
but I can be over at any time
You'll need to ping Fred too 😛
Hey <@!257986741896609802> I’m leaving work now so I could be super early
Yep!
So are we all good for tonight? 😃
yeah exactly
Like an alien probe or a meteorite or something
it solves a lot of problems about abiogenesis
that some probe was sent from somewhere else with microbes on it, that evolved into everything there is today
A really neat hypothesis thats not even that unlikely is directed panspermia
Another sad reality, is that on the super low conservative estimates, it could be like 1 or 2 intelligent species per galaxy. And the space between galaxies is so big its not really concievable to cross
Yeah I wish they'd save us
Theres probably 1M intelligent, communicative species in this galaxy alone
needs to emit powerful radio signals
and theres no way of finding that
thats arguably us
Like in very early stages of evolution
and we have no way of finding it
well then it wont find us
lol
Retarded
What if the life we find is like
:O
If the stars are an ocean, SETI has only looked at a glass of waters worth so far for looking for signals of life
If they are more high tech than us
Rather they have a good chance of discovering us...
Because our radio signals will have finally travelled far enough for anything out there to detect them
In the next couple hundred years, war ridden or not, we have a good chance of discovering Extra terrestrial life
BUT chances are
Because we are living through prosperity, and a peak of advancement, without war or dark age or disease
Also we were either born in like the best possible time, or a shitty time
So tiny
Half the time my phone takes photos bigger than that
Like 8mv
What annoys me too is the limit on image uploads
It's super annoying
And I know
That's so dumb
Also the fact they made custom emojis a nitro perk is so dumb
Nitro is such a rip off
👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩
:I
1000% of the time
Like what
I wish we were right 10 times for every 1 time!
Today in an announcement
10 times out of 1 we are right
When did he say that
Lol wtf
Wtf does this mean
"Are we right a 1,000 per cent of time? I wish we were right 1,000 per cent of the time," Ford added.
Right now the plan is still 6 but it's subject to change
what time is appt?
So am I

<@331154975457673228> does maps ask you how crowded the bus is everytime
Finally on baseline
So many stops
But only 7 minutes
14 stops left

They also hate left hand free :(
Lmao
WANNA

ALT J
The video was super cool
And that video helped get them big
Yeah! I think they were a lot smaller then
since it had a cool music video
you found it on reddit or something
Or left hand free
you showed me breezeblocks in like grade 11
I want to see breeze blocks live
Yeah same
Still my fav out of that whole list though
And hahaha
Jesus
it literally sounds like they dont know how to sing when they played live
Also lmao 24 stops
That's unfortunate
It'd be like the speaker's weren't tuned right
but really bad live
yeah, which sounds awesome when done in the studio
Mumbly
but you cant really do sound mixing live
And mubly
goes from whispering to yelling
a lot of the lyrics are like almost whispered
True
like thats difficult to do live
acapella over instruments and stuff
they are a very studio-band
its a challenging noise to get right live
:(
Oh how were they
Alt J is good, but they arent great live
Ive seen the killers and alt j
Besides alt j
They're artists I'd like to say I've seen but don't really care to
And true
<@296572507241054209> would appreciate alt j
just the types of people going to some of those concerts are going to be nasty
Yeah I was going to say I like some of those haha
okay some of those are sorta cool
lol
I know its gross
And the killers
And alt j
And logic
Snoop dogg and Wu Tang clan are playing at Bluesfest
unsullied
Also I love a fresh empty bus
God damn

Did it just drive past you
Ahhh

:(
i was lying on the pavement
lol idk, i was so mad
Like what even causes that
Wtf happened
Jesus
Transit was just like "I guess it's not coming"
i was late for class
i once waited 45 mins for a bus that comes every 15 mins
I had that oncr
next time it will never come
yeah you just spent all your luck
I've had that too
Lmao
They always just appear
it usually comes 30 mins late
I almost expect surprise busses now
lucky duck

Surprise 88
Oh baby
it assumes you insta-transfer
the ETA lies
Different places and give you good recourses
you done learned
learning curve
transfers suk
I know stuff like that can direct you to like
Idk how, I just know its offered to all workers and family
I'm at this bus stop until 11:30
Like through the help line?
Yeah I'll look into it more tomorrow
Ooh ok

Oh
I didn't really read anything I just found a helpline
real eyes realize real lies
Nick! What did the mental health page say!
a million stops too
lol yes
This route sucks

:o?
30 - 40 mins
<@136253782131474432>
Nick is 40 mins out
unless the 97 somehow caughht up to an 88
Nick tho!!
Haha
well, itll be the same either way
Otherwise itll be a lnger wait time at billings haha
Ok
If youre at hurdman hop off
See thats why transfers suck
Waiting
Should I stay on 97
Timed stop or waiting at hurdman?
15 minute wait time fuck
from billings to uottawa
but in oppsite direction
I used to take the 97 to school every day
the routes overlap there
it really doesnt matter where you hop off bertween hurdman and billings
but it will just go to billings anyways lol
That's what I'm going to do
I didnt think of that
from*
you could even grab 88 fomr hurdman
Fuck I'm still trying to clean
then hop off and transfer to 88
Oh shit!
I worked 7:45 to 11
After hurdman is a few stops then billings
Yeah
Wait are you on the bus rn Nick?
Yeah
It ends up going south
to hurdman?
That's not what the map says
yeah exactly
I'm going east now
Uuuh
you go almost opposite direction for a while
40 minutes :(
thats so much longer
I'm by the Queensway
awww man lol
Yes lol
are you on your way to billings bridge already lol
About the mental health and what not
What did the page say Nick!
Should have looked further into it
Also!!!
Bad guy is also pretty good I agree
It tells you to walk to Albert / Metcalfe lol
Albert / metcalfe
https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Slater+%2F+Metcalfe,+Ottawa,+ON/Baseline+2B,+1400+Woodroffe+Ave,+Nepean,+ON+K2G+0B5/@45.3841653,-75.7743491,13z/am=t/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cce05aabf4ae887:0xd7d29ddd95c6ede3!2m2!1d-75.6951965!2d45.4212336!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cce072276c281eb:0xfa91de1a5e500976!2m2!1d-75.7617219!2d45.3477619!3e3!5i1
Ah haha
it has extra stops along the way
39 mins iinstead of 31
Huh
it takes a little bit longer but yes
Does it go to baseline stationm
I've never been on that bus
Google maps suggested me nothing but Slater/Metcalfe routes
Also 86 or 87 from Albert / Metcalfe are also direct
Gdi
Ahhh
94 comes at 11:14
Then taken88 going west
Have to take 97 to hurdman
Oh I know but none were around apparently

Have to take a random bus home because my bus doesn't run during office hours apparently

<@331154975457673228> !! Can u still print off the d&d sheets :O
i was sleepin
So I'm on a little over an hour of sleep
And then got out of bed at 5:30am so that I could get off work early
Then I couldn't fall asleep again
Because of that I've also been up since then except I couldn't fall asleep until like 12:15
and i let her and the drunk pals come in to see the cat and then i got dressed and went out and partied
hey come and hangout
and yelled thru the window
stacey came by with her friends

Deliberate irony

🐜 🕷

👹
👨‍👧

I don't think I could do those dances in a recognizable way
orange justice maybe
floss for them
just a little
I will not do that
dance for them
Old guys at work are all in a conference room talking about fortnite
yeah lol
Like and your landlords money
Hahaha that's such a waste of electricity
i alwasy had all the windows open
but in winter its even hot inside lol
for the most part
hahah its finally off now i think
I noticed that in the hallway the other day
Doesn't your land Lord also blast heat fin
that was very very cold
dead of winter
except in the like
but our basement so far has been great
if i left the door open in basically any season for any amount of time
lol
she'd be like your letting the hot/cold air out!!!!
lol
my mom always got mad at me haha
conditioners
but if people have air ocnditoonsers then its colder
thats true
when inside is hotter than outside at least
oooh thats true
haha
When youre on the top floor it lets the rising hot air out though
blehhh
i mean you dont get stuffy but
lets hot air in
and no open windows are almost worse in hot weather
Air condition on MAX with windows closed did not save us
oh nooo
Open windows will not save you
in the fall when it was 30 out it was like 35 in here
is always hotter than the outside
But this 3rd floor apartment
Lol
god DAMN i love basement dwelling
it was alwasys like 22 MAX
even in 30 degree weather
The basement i lived in last year NEVER got hot
yes lol
itll definately be better than u guys in higher up apartments
that basement will not save you
:)))
heat also rises
the heat penetrates all
the heat will penetrate it
basement
cuz
we're actually lucky
so much heat incoming
the heat
I am scared of summer
like 6 hours
like and what we did was pretty damn as impressive we walked bbbbasically non-stop all day
yeah, i think stuff like that is super good for your mood
Nice day after a long dark winter
Me too that was a great day
I feel sorta good tbh

Lmao
maybe its that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
hahah nah my gpa used to drive around the lawnmower, its a great mode of transportation
They're driving to lcbp on a lawn mower
That makes it bad
I think it's the lawn mower
I just remember that literally no one cared
Like I think I used to carry the booze for my parents but don't quote that
I think it's cute makes me feel the nostalgias
Used to give me sips of what they were drinking ♥️♥️♥️♥️
My parents used to bring me there all the time haha
its great minus the part its the liquor store
I would have 😂
I bet u anything the kid loves it
Haha
You didn't grow up in a small town in ontario if your dad didn't drive the ol lawnmower over to the LC BO dragging you behind in that wagon
My parents used to take me to the lobo with them
I had that same wagon
It's oddly kinda cute
Idk it makes me feel nostalgic
lol
It was on /r/trashy
nah lol
just another day in small town ontario

Hank kind of lost it
ignorance is bliss
he was so much better off inocent

Hank
Yea
We'd binge the seasons in like a week or two then have to wait like a year
Also
Id hate that
Fuuuck
Since I watched the seasons as they came out, I had to wait a year to see what happened after that season ender

HOW DEEP
Do you have any ideab

This absolutely wild film I watched a review of

You guys should watch "Moon" at some point

Also you said something about weekend fin? I’m free-ish after 5:00 on Saturday, and free before 5:00 on Sunday.
But it’s over. It’s all over. I gotta watch better call Saul at some point.
I’m glad jessy survived. Poor kid.
Also: the doctor gave Walt 2 years to live. He died 2 years later. He wanted to beat cancer and he did; his own bullet killed him. This means no one but Walt gets the satisfaction of killing him.
GOOD show. I rate 5/7. Perfect score
All I can say is
I have finished breaking bad
I call being Walt jr
It’s her underbite
Or Jesse
They just do everything in their power to say fuck Skylar but !!!!!!! U Kno what we were all Skylar/Walt Jr for 2 years with kurtn
Unflattering
And make her dresssss
It's just the way they do her haiiiirrr
I feel like the actress isn't even ugly
And that's just mean
I can't remember
Which is bad
I feel like people hate skylar more because she’s ugly
What's their babys name?
Haha
Best character is baby
Stuffs that away with her being like beyond fucking insufferable
But the show kind of like
In any real life situation Skylar is pretty justified
Because like
I know but I don't like that
Is all
Actually wait
Instant nope!!
It’s trying to blur the lines it all
But the goal is to make a slow descent into depravity
Haha p
I sorta agree actually
Nope
But I feel the writers are like okay we need these people to be deplorable now so we can hide how deplorable Walt is for later
And I really don't like that because I feel they're justified in a lot of it
I mean Walt's entire family is annoying af
I Stan Walter junior
Walt jr started being annoying way before that
Walt Jr called him a pussy
Like obviously that was him being prideful
It wasn't I watched that episode yesterday haha
But Walt jr hated him before any of that lol
And it's like FUCK YOU WALTER
Like obviously that’s stupid
This was before that
NOOOO
But he was like
He got it offered to be paid for!!!
He had like a 30% chance of survival to begin with
Just because he's leaving behind a pregnant wife and disabled son
That was literally his logic
He didn’t want them to be in debt for life
Haha he did it for his family
He hasn’t even made money from drugs yet
I feel that Walt is being selfish with not wanting to get treatment
That was before Walt was bad
Likeeee fuck I would never do that to my dad
Fuck it up Walter junior
That’s his choice
Like wtf
Because his dad wanted to not have treatment
Yeah haha Flynn
He renamed himself pretty early
Hahah
If I had a name like Walter Jr and I couldn't walk I'd be annoying too
Like when he wants to talk or be honest and she shits all over it
Hahah justified up until the point she punishes him for the sake of getting even and not to make things better
Because she DOESN'T DESERVE THAT DAMMIT SHE IS JUSTIFIED
Walt jr is super annoying too
I have and she is and I hate it
She’s literally the worst
Watch the show
She’s also so annoying
STOP THAT

Ted is the police man right
Woman was pregnant with a disabled son and a fucked ass husband and gets treated like SHIT by EVERYONE your mean to hate her just !!!!!!

Like.. just god dammit Skylar deserved better
I have watched it in bits and pieces and I just really really hate it
Well it’s up there
But it’s still the best show ever
I get too stressed
It’s very hard for me to watch
DAMN dirty
Yes it makes me angry too
Hahaha
That and they did Skylar damn dirty
I just don't like Walter, I can't watch it it just makes me angry
One time I went to the bathroom and she came in while I was peeing and WOULDN'T. LEAVE.
Well I’m still of the opinion it is one of the greatest shows of all time, and that if it makes you a drug dealer that is more from external reasons and the show shouldn’t be the blame, it’s just a catalyst, not any of the reactants
Like
Norma has kissed me multiple times
It
Hate
Oh my god I hate that house
BASICALLY tho I've boycotted breaking bad for semi personal reasons and Y E S
Can you imagine living in a household like that
He drugged his dad?
😦
Like the time he knocked his dad out with Xanax but worse
'lets go fuckin murder my dad I saw it on Dexter'
He'd be like 'oh lads'
Well let’s hope he watches some bob ross and is swayed into pacifism
I 100% believe he's that easily swayed
He's said some FUCKEDDDD things to me
Hehe
HE VERY WELL COULD BE
I MEAN
Well thank goodness he didn’t watch dexter or he would be a serial killer right now
He like.... Worshiped Walter white
It was all in the works but I just feel that breaking bad didn't help
Garett was smoking weed before Kurt
And that in of itself is obviously a way bigger problem but I'm honing in on the one thing that I know negativly affected him and I'm like ... boycotting it
Alcoholic parents and drug addicted brother
There’s also the factor of him not having a great home life
And it was always based on whatever media he was watching or consuming
Like I knew Kurt would literally sway with the wind in how he'd act
I 100% see what you mean though
I just can't
But I just don't like it either
Im blaming Kurt not the show
Because the nazis lived cool lives in it
It’s like saying watching inglorious basterds made someone into a 4th Reich neonazi
He is never satisfied, he is always paranoid
And like I believe you should be able to understand not acting like every character you see in media
And the show makes it obvious
He destroys himself
Like he never ever gets rewarded, any wins are short lived and never even last an episode
I mean he has a right to exist
He doesn’t get rewarded though
And in the cases that Walter DOES get rewarded that's enough justification for them to say there see
Up*
This is like the whole argument that violent movies make kids shoot UO schools
Too easily swayed by media to say to themselves maybe this isn't meant to mean I should model myself after this
I think for most people breaking bad should turn them off that kind of lifestyle
Mostly it's people like Kurt that characters like Walter white are bad for
Okay ew
That’s John with Quentin tarantino stuff
HHHHHH
Like when people are like “you need a really high IQ to understand this”
Like the horrible fan base thing
Yeah....
John ruined quentin Tarantino?
Or like how John ruins Quentin Tarantino
Shame when people (Kurt) ruin good things for others
Because you already made up your mind before watching it
I just can't agree I just really don't like breaking bad
And blames himself
And Jesse has to watch the dad take her body away
Flips her on her back and watches her choke on her puke
Any excitement you have in season 1 when you still root for him is gone by season 2 when he kills jesses gf
None of it is romanticized
Walt’s family
Jesses gf
(Mike, Jesse, etc)
While bringing down everyone around you
It literally does everything in its power to show you the consequences outweigh any benefits and you always die and live a horrible life in the end
They have to dissolve him in acid and they cry their eyes out
He takes days to do it
He has to kill someone with a bicycle lock
It literally makes it the most horrifying thing possible in every way
It does not romatisize any of it
Unless you have mental health issues or no empathy
No one ever likes Walter in the end
Because as in with Kurt they see themselves in Walter and then use the character as a way of justifying their shit behavior
Nope it really didn’t
I feel it romanticized this way of life too much before it was able to make it's point
I just.... Don't like breaking bad
Again I've never been able to watch the show but him being in a hero role I guess is where the confusion comes from
It makes the point as clear as possible
Well you’re not supposed to like the character at the end (like Kurt)
But characters like Walter white are really hard to do right and really hard to make the point clear with
I've seen a few short essay type things that explain it better than I do
Honestly it came off to me as like romanticizing this horrible horrible person while still showing him off as a badass, I think my veiw of him is tainted mostly because of Kurt to be fair so I just unfairly dislike the show but
To the point where you’re not supposed to cheer for him at some point
Well like I said the goal of the show is to take anti hero to its limit
I just don't think he deserves to be in the top 5 anti heroes
With everyone ultimately (hopefully) drawing it before the end
Honestly I've only watched a few episodes so I can't accurately argue this BUT from what I've learned you should still be able to like an antihero, I'm not saying Walter is a bad character by any means
It tests you to find where you draw the line
But that’s predominantly not he case
I mean obviously someone born with a brain tumour in an area that makes them aggressive is born
And that the line between good and bad is fuzzy not clear
Through their environment and circumstances
To show you that they are created not born
The whole goal of the show is to get you to try to sympathize with bad people tjoigh
Walter I really don't think is a good antihero just because he's so utterly deplorable
BASICALLY you should still at least sympathize with them
I was taught (to be fair it was in character design) that an antihero made you like them for their flaws
Where these are your textbook examples of a hero they follow this outline sort of thing
Like you know the literary hero attributes thing
Just because he's not like, your typical hero attributes
Totally!*
Tortallt
They have Hamlet listed here and that makes more sense to me
Like not ... Your typical hero
Like a hero who isn't strong or smart =  anti hero
Ahh
Heroes but not NOT heroes
I was only ever taught that anti heroes were like
It’s a bit confusing though I agree
Yeah and ok I just looked it up Walter is considered one
Or maybe even mr bean
Because they just suck at everything
I bet you could even argue the guys from Superbad are antiheroes
It’s just any character that doesn’t have traditional heroic character traits is what I’ve always thought
Fuck
I haven’t 😦
The wizard from that is an antihero
Macbeth you root for but then he ends up being an awful dude
U ever watched the last Unicorn?
Which is basically Walter white
I’ve heard that Macbeth is anti hero though
Uhhh
No no that's not an anti hero either
Mold of a typical hero
Antagonist who slowly becomes protagonist
Or
They're just heroes that don't follow the mold of the story
Megamind is exact opposite
Walter is a protagonist who slowly descends into an antagonist
Like anti heros aren't bad guys
Yeah that's mega mind!
Central character but not traditionally hero
He follows it better than Walter
...... Kkkkkinda
The serial killer who only kills bad guys
Anti hero is like dexter
I learned this in school haha
He’s just a villain who becomes a hero
Yes but he's considered an antihero
Like he ends up doing good
Isn’t megamind a hero?
Mega mind is an anti hero
Or you may still cheer for them but you’re not always meant to, and they don’t have hero qualities
They're still the hero but they lack the typical attributes of a hero but they are still the hero
No they are still
Just a central character but not someone you want to cheer for
I’m going by this
https://www.google.com/search?q=anti+hero&rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA840CA840&oq=antiheri&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.2635j0j4&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8
Mega mind**
Like meganind
Anti hero
It’s it the exact opposite of a hero...
Just not your typical hero mold
Heroes
I see what you mean
Anti heros are still like
He's not a hero at all!!!!
!!!
Walter isnt an anti hero
The slow descent along the gradient of what’s considered acceptable
Noooo!!!
It’s the entire concept of the show
Total anti hero
The show does like everything in its power to show you that he is no longer someone to cheer for lol
(Kurt)
And yeah I dislike when people still like Walter as a character after the show ends
So what are your guys plans for the weekend
I feel so bad for what he's put Jessie through
Yeah he's a fucking psychopath
Walter White is a monster
All I can say so far is
But
I’ve only got 2 episodes left in season 5
Oh I forgot there was even a fourth modern warfare
The creative team ran out of juice
very creative
lol
Modern Warfare
And now
Oh fuck yeah that too lmao
And modern warfare remasteerd
And Modern Warfare 3
And Modern Warfare 2
Yeah lol
havent we had that before
So the new CoD is called CoD:Modern Warfare
hahaha it was the 95
Also thats sweet

Hahah I literally watched that MC video last night at like 1am
2pm
Going to a meeting at Microsoft at 2p?
Fuck
Google Chrome deleted itself from my work computer and im not able to reinstall it
It sounds like someone running their nails down chalk with a "hey kids" edit
It needs an exorcism
It starts normal but then gets distorted and extremely loud
This bus's stop button sound is absolutely horrifying
This is fucked

He wanted none of this.

for no good reason
ruthlessly and senselessly

Guys help
Balls
Wow
What
He
He got kicked off
A guy just came on the bus without paying and lit up a cigarette
I’m bussing to Nepean again
Also funny aside: I love when we are just talking in DnD and Shon randomly rolls
Best humor is bad humor
#horriblememesthatIdontagreewithbutmademechuckle
Nooooooo
Oh nooooo
The worst one was the one that was "They dont stop coming" on repeat, showing streams of immigrants
lol
Idk why but this is peak comedy to me
This one is also great
https://youtu.be/8qMtsir0l9k
Oh "The Best, The Best, The Best, The Best"
8O
Uhhhh
ALSO theres the foo fighters one
think about it think about it think about it
And that one hahah
"They dont stop coming"
Ive seen thta hahah
There was one where they literally just repeated think about it over and over

Fuck I can't find the meme
Think about it
lol meme
Well baby I surrender to the strawberry ice cream
Like I listened to it entirely too much
I used to absolutely lose it to this song
https://open.spotify.com/track/3OltYYcLZUhvho5QoRbUNr?si=eyx0mfhGTRC4Kvt27H-l6A
*Trumpet solo*
These lyrics are so wholesome
IVE GOT TO BE KING OF THE ROOOOOADDD
Road man slow it down and you will get there safe and sound
Driving in the road van!
Breaking land speed records in the van
Road man!
I don't think that's smash mouth tho
Accidentally in love that song
I used to really REALLY like uhhh
https://open.spotify.com/track/50uYYNVsBYbg8ZuGWN3JSd
Hahah Smash Mouth was the next beatles until shrek
Road Man is my shit
Shrek MADE smash mouth
I know every word to every song on the album
As adorable as that is I don't think you can say Shrek ruined smash mouth when your point of critical reference is from when you were 4 years old
I listened to it a fair bit after shrek too lol, in this little radio my dad got my for my borthday that had a CD player in it
Like 4
How old were u
I don't even know what to say
Finn
Shrek ruined everything
Not joking, I used to listen to Astro Lounge (The Album) BEFORE Shrek
Good
Proudly listening to smash mouth at work
Oh fuck haha
haha oh noo
had my window open this morning, and holy shit did that ever wake me up at 5:30 AM
The thundering clash and rumble is enough to give you vietname flashbacks even if youve never been
I swear to god when its done it just drops it, doesnt gently let it down
holy shit there is nothing louder than when the garbage truck empties the massive metal garbage thing in the alley behind my house
hehe
she likes it when you scratch around the outside of her ear its so cute
ahh i discovered a new thing kenya really likes
Sean we will never let go of little niddle
that means a lot
Thank you finre
But in reality, when we do get food, I will definitely help cover your share of the cost
stop
I will volunteer to vomit the niddle so that you may ceremonially consume it each session
Which is when it’s partially digested and removed from the stomach to be consumed by another
*vomit intensifies*
The only thing worse than little niddle would be little niddle tripe
*vomit*
So little niddles it is
yes true
🥘 🍕 🍔
Besides, the Greeks came out of the Trojan Horse's belly
Truu
So I do not ask for moony. I ask for fuud
But while you *could* pay me
I would feel almost guilty taking money. We are hanging out having fun.
But I cant say no to food.
I guess don’t look a gift horse in the mouth
***NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO***
Lol we only make you little niddles when you’re over
And hahaha
Those ghosts are how I imagine the spirits of the dead city in our campaign
**NO LITTLE NIDDLE**
*NO*
Many many little middles
Which you can then convert to food
Maybe currency is better
And haha
https://youtu.be/kXF3VYYa5TI
***I love food***
let this *reinforce* your belife
let this not change your mind
Oh no haha
*I love food*
I will eat until I physicly cant if food is before me
and I will -never- say no to food
a lot
I love food
I cannot say no to this
I feel like we should make a point out of feeding Shon each session. Like the amount of work he puts into this is crazy
“You awake to frantic knocking on your barricaded door”
😀😀😀😀
He says he is free all Mondays!
Alrightry
I’ll ask him about consistency

So I built him a lil water purification thing
Alright. Well it should be good if he can make the time
He didn't know how to get good water
He’s a super creative dude, used to play a lot of halo with him and we would just mess around in Forge and design hilarious maps
At one of his parties haha
Haha no way
I helped him build a settlement in fallout 4
I see
Very nice guy
Has played DnD before
He is a bit quiet, he’s in engineering
Matt Featherston. He was my neighbour since Grade 3
Thats fine. Who is this "Matt"
I'm completely yes
Absolutely
Matt was wondering if maybe he could be introduced into the DnD session at some point, if everyone else was down. He could probably have his character prepared and you could just check it over. No worries if you think that will be too many though
lol
🙏🙏🙏
lol
One of them yelled sorry everyone as they got off lol
just pure plastered
oh man
But they got off and one of them was carrying a huge bottle of wine mostly drunk
I thought they had downsyndrome from how they were talking
These people on this bus are absolutely shit faced
Also completely empty
It's a really nice place
At Maclarens rn
Haha not yet
I’m leaving baseline as you’re heading there
Haha Leonard is cheering you on
Good luck fin lol
lol
Training
Bunkering down for the next 3 hours of train info
Nepean city councilor in 1950
Is Leonard an important fancy man
Dude looks scary

Jk
Hahaha
Downtown they’d be too drugged out to skateboard without dying
Yeah that sounds like nepean
Lmao
Just saw a gang of heavily tattooed green haired middle aged people skateboarding past, who ripped a tulip out of a garden
Nepean life
Kinda depressing that the cafeteria for this entire building has only like 5 people sitting in it at noon thirty
There’d be more co-ops but I think this session is for all of the ones who started one week late like me
Errr it’s a dental practise worker, like oversees municipal rules and certifications related to dentistry
Oh wow :o
And like 15 co-ops across whatever
There’s a welder, call center lady, dentist, daycare worker, IT guys, HR lady, water distribution people
City of Ottawa is so big and diverse
Oh damn
It’s like 100 random from across the 9 departments
Is there a lot of new people
All that mandatory stuff
And accessibility
And health and safety
It’s like orientation
What are you training for?
Holy shit that's a little unfair
And I only get 45 mins for lunch and am a 20 min walk away
Oh no D:
I had to take a cab in bc I was late
Not enough time 😦
Why didn't you come say hi 😡😡 <@331154975457673228>

:O
Drove past your house
By working I mean attending mandatory training and orientation
Been working in Nepean today



I will once I start work!

And then I sat there for a minute and he went back to bed
And I said do you mean tomorrow like today ? And he said yes
And I said tomorrow like tomorrow and he said yes
I was sleeping on the couch as I often do because I'm a disorganized POS and it helps me wake up if I'm not comfortable in bed and I was sort of awake and then Nick bursts into the living room kind of angry seeming and I thought it was because I fell asleep before I did the dishes ... And the laundry but but then he starts talking about needing to move the car tomorrow for the guy with the pitiful beard so he can get out of the driveway and that's why he had to wake up so early in the morning
Also the strangest thing just happened
Also I'm sorry Finn
They do look yummy haha
And lol those look good
I fell asleep early for once in my life and a scam call called me and woke me up
I never see my name on anything
I got so excited

DIng Sings
They're a little roughed up but they're looking good
Oh boy its the twins

Guess who came in the mail today
And the Mc server?
I'm proud of myself
Just from memory
Also I got on this bus without checking any apps
The downstairs was full but upstairs is dead haha
And haha you missed the rush
I should probably get back on the server at some point
It's so empty too
It’s great
Got a nice view at the front
The upstairs of double decker busses is fun
Ok almost there
Oh lmao

Looks like fun and it's nice and sunny out
Watching construction people outside hanging out on a tall building
Man I feel like I could be a construction guy

https://outline.com/J8PPkc Doug Ford's declaring Ontario bankrupt ffs
What did ur boss say !!
:O!!
Went well!
How did it go though?
Oh I see, that would stress me out really bad too especially for sleeping
Well I mean its (8-9) - (4-5) work days, but this was the first day back after my boss has been gone for 5 days, and he wanted to talk to me about progress, so I wanted to be in at 8:30 at the latest in case he beats me here and is waiting to talk to me
Why did you have to be there so early <@331154975457673228>
So I make work only put me in in the afternoon 😂
Sleep usually comes to me but I always take 30 minutes to an hour to fall asleep
Oh man yeah hard start times stress me tf out
I dont get it often, but I knew i had to be at work for 8:30 sharp today so i guess that stressed me out
Aww nick has that problem too
Just cant fall asleep sometimes when i need to
How come?
Oh nooo
didnt go to sleep until like 2
Your tired Finn?
So tired


:((((((
oh man das nasty

Had to shower n stuff
Hey guys just leaving now
@everyone
Be there 45
Leaving in 10
Wish I didn’t have to bus
Wish I didn’t have to bus
Wish I didn’t have to bus
Alright, see ya soon
Leaving now
will do!
Anyway let me know what you're outside
I wonder too
No idea
Instill wonder what you did to it
Hahaha that's no problem
so ill walk slow 😛
My knee is better but I still got a bit of a hobble
Cool!
Alright. I can join you on the walk back
So may grab some stuff
Open
I think the macs would be over
I could walk over to your apartment btw we didnt really get any snacks
haha thats fine
Brianna's in bed hungover though but that shouldn't be an issue
I'm down for hanging out before!
Anyway, I can be over at any time if you want to hang out early. Or just arive when fin does 😛
Fucking modded servers lol
lol
Oh man
Joined a random server and it ranked me up 65 ranks
Playing some classic WaW multiplayer
that is a good one
Arms of Hadar is pretty good if youre being swarmed
Kinda one opportunity to control the battlefield to your advatage
or maybe infront of one of their own's blows
good to position them within range of party member
yeha
Be aware your spending your action to move them. While that can be useful, if there is no cliffs or hazards, they will probobly just walk back to the fight.
Eh. I never liked disarms. Go for it if you want it.
I sorta do
You agree with it?
no idea
Who wrote this note
HBThis spell is somewhat overpowered. Forced movement is one thing, but forced disarmament is very strong. I would recommend allowing only forced movement or forced disarmament, not both.
If one is nearby, yea :p
And ah true
puppet is good bc you can just make an opponent run off a cliff
Its your call. Be aware warlocks are very limited spell-slot wise (unless you make a point to take a short rest) therefor utility may not be the best call for them (if they even have that many utility spells
as opposed to just attacking and messing with oponents
or helping your party
or healing
I feel like we need some spells that are more on the defense side to stir things up
hehehehe
They will come up.
ARE there lots of aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead in this setting?
Which is good
So it doesnt take an action
Helish rubuce has 1 requierment, listed in casting time. When you take damage, you use your reaction. Ill get into combat later, but basicly a reaction happens when its not your turn.
Ahhh
Yes. Concentration means you have to... concentrate on it. You can only concentrate on 1 spell at a time. Whenever you take damage, your concentration is tested, and you have to make a spell save.
So I guess I can just do it whenever
Hellish has none of them
Maybe not
Theres also I think C which is concentrate?
Note; you start with an arcane focus/componet pouch. But it can be stolen/lost. Theoreticly.
Basicly what all this means is this:
If its got a V, and you gagged/scilenced/dont want to make a sound, you cant cast it.
If its got a S, and your hands are bound/paralyzed, dont want to make obvious movments, you cant cast it.
If its got a M, and you dont have arcane focus/componet pouch, and/or you dont have the gold cost item, you cant cast it.
Hard to get things like a twig from a tree recently struck by lightning
Ahhh
How you cast the spell. Verbal, Samatics, Material.
Verbal means you need to speak arcane language (or say something) to get the spell to go off. Can be eldrich toung, arcane language, or yelling the spells name. (Flavor up to you) but people can hear you casting a spell.
Samatics means you must move your hands and/or body to cast the spell. Pointing, claping hands, doing the wiggle, etc.
Material means that you need some material to cast the spell. This means you need one of the following:
If there is no gold cost for the material, and you have either an arcane focus or a componet pouch, your character uses that for the material costs.
If there IS a gold cost, you will need to have that item on hand in order to cast the spell, in adition to possibiliy needing an arcane focus/componet pouch.
You can, if lacking a focus/pouch, have the items on hand. Like worms. Or pixy dust. Or whatever it says.
mean?
So what does "Components: V, S, M"
a good one im debatting is Puppet too
I get this look in my eye and point my finger at them
Hehehe
yes. When somone hits you they instantly REGRET
Hellish REBUKE
That is good
I can come over any time <@!136253782131474432> . 2:00, 3:30, 5:00, etc
I have chosen 1/2 of my spells
Hi

https://i.imgur.com/79l9Pdv.jpg
Im good then
I’ll try for earlier the better though
If that works?
@everyone
Tomorrow
So ill try to be there for 5pm
Would be hilarious to jointly all vote to trade embargo Venice
Took capital
Waited for peace treaty to expire
Made peace for all their cities except capital
Pelted their coasts with frigates, and their stream of units with canons
Destroyed their economy
I voted to trade embargo my enemy
Keeping some around for trade routes of course
In my most recent game I said fuck it to wonder greediness, and once I got my economy to am acceptable level, I started taking whatever other Civ’s cities were against my borders (within reason)
Haha
Off on his own continent funnelling billions of dollars into the Middle East to sew chaos and strife and war
So I just thought of something funny which is that Shon in our last Civ game was essentially america
that's what I love about it
😃
*floods house*
I love it
I got all the windows open
It is
Rain is really comming down now
yes
I love a good thunderstorm
more thunder
dare indeed
2spoopy4me
dare I say
thats 105% too spoopy
oh no take it back that's too spooky

pls gif spoopy
spoopy
I know it's spooky
oh man thunder
Oh yeah we could play that too
Yea interested in seeing that. If briana is there we could play some of the things she likes too, like the mushroom one
Yeah
that you had to buy each one individualy?
yes
pre-made decks
That was the one with the custom decks?
Could play key forge
Oh* i'm down
I'm i'm down
Also, fin might take a while, but I could maybe come over earlier on monday and we could play bord games or something
Yea would be
Even $50 would be nice
Yeah
should make a little off it
Iphone 5c I think
lol
It's going straight onto ebay
what Iphone is it?
my brother gave it to me for free lol
Nice
New phone

That's beautiful
😭😭😭😭
https://i.imgur.com/9ONNDuD.jpg

Pls gif intervention
;P
about your civ adition
we gotta have an intervention
lol
Lmao
From staying up late without eating or drinking I think
I have a nasty Civ hangover
Ah shit right
And I’m probably not free until a bit later than that because I need to work out a ride back from bogieland
Course
Which episode was that?
Gotta finish Br Ba
You should it's a really good show
I have not watched that
Oh haha
Silicon Valley lol
what is that

Cool!
Alright. We will see for everyone else too
Maybe like 2pm
I'm good whenevrr
:D happy to hear that!
Also my knee seems to be getting better! I might not need a ride monday, might be able to just walk normaly 😃
Ayy good. So what time would everyone be good at thne?
Yes!
Ehy, sometime last week somone mentioned is getting together earlier on Monday? Longer dnd session or just more hang out time or whatever. That still true? If so when would we start on Monday?
Classic
When I don’t wanna get up to poop so you get your mom to bring you the chamber pot

But longer is more fun in many sittings
Haha these last like 7 hours to get to industrial
yes
https://images.app.goo.gl/tzK2HtSh7fED37C4A
I like really long games over many small ones
My body hates me
I have played 4 games of Civ V, from first city to industrial era in one sitting in the past 4 days
😦
I'm so sad
I know horses will jump to their death over cliffs if they are in too much pain. No idea about a mouse.
:(
not sure if its smart enough to understand that
Noooooo
could be in that much pain
it might be trying to crawl outside so something can eat it
But he could have at least died somewhere comfortable :(
it will only make it suffer more
Definitely
nothing you do will save it
its best to let it die
If its neck is broken
It was so small and kept trying to walk but it'd go in circles
I wanted to put him somewhere comfy

I feel awful
I hate it but I can't step on it
It's probably going to be dead very soon anyway
It curled up outside
Yeah....
Crushing its head would be swift, and if you did it right, put it out of its pain quickly. But its... messy.
im not sure a better way to kill it then maybe suffication/drowning. Thats the least hands-on
crushing its head?
Besides like
No
Hum
She did not kill it?
Kenya caught a mouse and like broke its neck or something
<@331154975457673228>
How do you put a mouse out of their misery
Oooh it's ramping up noa
so excited to see what 5 brings
it would have been a good ending
if it just ended at season 4
but
have not watched any of season 5 yet
I finished season 4
Lmao
pizza pizza was just a front for the bigest meth production this side of the border
There was a huge crowd around it filming
I have no idea what for
Lol yeah
And they were searching his car
lol really?
There was like two cop cars
And one of the people got arrested
oh for what
There's a modded car meetup in the home depot parking lot
Also someone got arrested at pizza pixxa
Yeah basically there's going to be so much they won't be able to justify charging
guessing there will be lots of dlc
Interesting
new cod may be F2P
Never had that problem here
We get mice under our sink a lot
good, you shouve be able to avoid em then
I'm pretty good for that 👌👌
Yea well, just make sure you have no crumbs on the ground for long times or anything and take out the trash/clean sink regularly and it should be fine
Haven't gotten that yet but we haven't been here in the summer yet
Oof that would suck
fixed that real quick
we got ants once
Naw
Haha you guys probably don't get any rats or mice in your apartments eh
best of luck with her hunting

She is
shes hunting
With a short snack break in between
Kenya has been staring at this wall listening for a rat/mouse for a solid 15 minutes

hahaha
https://i.imgur.com/CrUmGUZ.jpg

Brianna angry at me because I'm in a home depot shed

I see
I think alll three
or the concept of public transportation
or the bus itself
Because of the people that ride em?
Brianna is afraid of them though
Same
I have not had a bad time with busses
Could probably have switched seats
😦
Not a good first time with busses
Well right behind then
So we sat right beside someone fucked out of their mind
Well let us know if it guess worse Shon!

If thats the case, it might just recover on its own! 😄
and its no worse then yesterday. So I might have hit its peak
I thinking about going to somewhere maybe
If you need to get it checked out we can drive you to the emergency or hospital
Wondering if you should get checked out
Is it worse?
Oh I’m sorry Shon 😦
Your knee is still that bad?
Oh shit dude yeah no problem. At all
if my knee is not better
you might need to pick me up

All of yea having fun

I'm a tourist

lol
A Windows update took down most of the correctional services of Canada servers
Hahaha she idles a LOt
but geeez 4000
my mum was prob similar in civ iii
oh holy shit
And 4000 hours in plants vs zombies lol

Civ
My mum has like 2000 hours in civil 3
There's so many reasons I hate this
Also ew
>8o we weren't that lit!! <@331154975457673228>

Alternatively me on Tuesday after work hah
^nick and Brianna at the bar earlier tonight
🥴
Ahhh yeah
Couldnt you also terraphorm late game?
And ruin tile improvements
You could also bombard land tiles from ships
Which was pink
She always played as Mecca
She was addicted to CIv III
I remember watching my mum move a stack of 100 tanks
I think a little bit of stacking is good
Huh
I think in civ 6 you can stack a little
it was a big reasonb they changed it later
Yea
Like unlimited stacking
In*
<@!257986741896609802> did you know that I’m Civ III you could stack units
And he will drop off an amphibian army to storm the beaches of my capital
It’s possible that these 7 musketmen are a ruse and he has had me build a maginot line
I think I might get rekt if Nate is pulling a fast one on me
And growth is 10% faster or something
(None)
Just like trade routes with other freedom states get more money
My early tier stuff sucked
yea
I needed 3
U just need one factory
Freedom is good
Yep
Can you even get an ideology as Venice?
Peace is good
+176gpt, 33 happiness, 6 allied states, +50 faith per turn, +80 culture per turn, Freedom ideology
Man was I ever thriving in peace times
That was later
he got great wall of CHINA
But woulda been a rough time still
And I had amassed quite a defense line
Nate has sold half his military off
I dont think you would have survived to that point lol
If all else stayed the same
Building that thing woulda put me one vote in front of you by industrial times
Lol
they are like "what"
political victory
then suddunly
you become the warmongers little bitch
see thats how you win as venice
"end Fin"
He said he woulda done it too
I would litteraly put all my GPT to him
then I fund your ally
It was literally the forbidden fruit
so I delcare war to stop it
it was gpt
Forbidden palace
Well
Also how mad would you have been if I built that wonder after giving me all that gold
thats good
but she cut me off
spread rapidly
Without your help and intervention!
I think I’ll survive this one
I could like
if I got a few cities under my control
but yea
I even have trades with her
lol I know
I don’t understand how
Portugal’s been at -30gpt like the whole game
due to that bitch
I could not get ANY city under my religon
Then it was the reverse
Ahhh
but
my trade roughts to cities converted to my religon give a shit tone of pressure
Per use
What I like about the great prophet was that it converts holy city, and always converts every citizen
See due to my trades
Jesus
so I cant compeate with that
every one of them can be used 3 times instead of 2
and
they got 3 free ones
But went for great prophet one instead
I almost made that
Ew
so they countered any miussonaries I made
they got the wonder for misonaries
they
the person
Yea
I removed Islam
My entire continent is my religion lol
I hope so
yea I got fucked religiously
Not sure if followers from other nations count
I have like 100 followers
I’d be dead in the water if it weren’t for 1 gold for every two followers of my religion
Geez
my trades are worth 25-29 gpt lol
14-17gpt
capital trade is greate
It’s about the same as a land caravan from capital
yea
Not as effective since it’s not the capital though
or is it 50%
Yeah, I have a few boats out of other port
you get 25% more gold from a sea trade vs land trade
I accidentally fell asleep
Aww
And nah
Helped a ton
:o
sea trade is worth 25% more
Waaaay better tiles early on
U guys still playing?
Also better luxuries further away
trade
oncean
but
Total waste
Because ocean was like straight line and I didnt want 3 tiles of adjacent ocean
you should have moved it
lol
Bad placement
Hah
why
Yes
1 tile away from the ocean
also is your capital like
Ill send a trade ship when I see your city
So I can upgrade to cavalry which will help
I get military science in a few turns
it went the wrong way lol
I have a ship going around
U need to explore
South
Yeah
idk where that city is
so I can only have 1 trade with you
damn]
Only 1 😦
My capital is production powerhouse
do you have costal cities?
And 4 rifleman only 1 or 2 turns away
And Gatling guns
But what I do have is cannons
I don’t have the luxury of trading with Poland
good luck with that
My frigate is breaking some next turn 😛
Yes he does
I think he has trades with poland
and he had still close to 100 gpt
to buy units
Geez
just saved up
he has 2k gold
Also have you explored like at all?
he uh
I looked
And Nate (Netherlands) has like 10 musket men but my Gatling guns in the citadel are doing well
its your roomate
Poland wasn’t a very big threat after all
I’m defending well
For the war
My situation is looking okay
also
lol yea they are nuts
I’m in range of Portugal but don’t want their filthy religion influence
And haha wow
that just no one is in range of
I have a few prophets / missionaries heading to Portugal hehe
I have 3 missing trade rought slots
That’s pretty good
or was it 180
150 or so
Mine is still floating up at like
Yikes
rip economy
Yea over 3 turns
So it went 176 -> 100 -> 50
Ohhh
yea
I had 100 during war time you mean?
50 gpt left
55
then my trade ended
You had 100 gpt
Yeah.... from the trade route loss 😦
you had 50 gpt last round
But when I got war declared on me by the whole continent I lost all 5 trade routes
I checked
I actually had 165 without you
so you had only 50
gpt ended to you
my uh
by the end
how was your situation
good
I saved it
save so your roomate can go to bed hehe
<@!331154975457673228>
Fin you should save
still frozwen?
uhh
oh no
both
its frozen for us
your budy is taking a while
no
is it frozen for you?
ok
youll have to try and hold out a little ibt
it will take me a few turns to sort this out
And ill give you 25 gpt to work with
and I'll see if I can pull some strings
OKAY 100%
with all your votes
Downvote your own proposal
I literally share like 40 tiles worth of border
I could make you a deal
Well...
im sandwhiched in the middle
lol
I cant convince either of them

I need eiether poland or nate to go to peace with me
I need help

It couldnt be text, because I boght my first phone form you
I just remember like the impression i got of you
I could see it being text
idk
Nah maybe steam?
in like early highschool
we were randomly chatting on something, maybe over text?
I actually remember my first real impression of nick
you were teaching me about picking skins n shit
Haha yeah I remember that
because i wanted to join a server with like you and sawyer or something
then i spent 25 bucks
Thats how i started i think
Do you remember connecting to hacked servers so you could play without a real account
Haha same
real acount in second
I got the torrented version of fist
not first though
i definitely was aorund for 2nd panel
its the least garbage
I like the new one
Gravle is always disgusting
I still think beta gravel was the best
Oh man I love the good old high saturated days
https://i.redd.it/0a6a7g37qhy21.jpg

Oi nick
Hahaha you'd have a heart attack
cant imagine how i would respond to actual harder stuff
fin actualy drinks liquid adderall
drugs work too well on me
lmao
It sounds like your coffee is actually Adderall
like i dont really get hungry
coffee makes me lose my apetite
my heart was bouncing earlier
My legs bouncing a bit but that's it
Casual
ive had 2 and im dying
Good idea

Should I drink a fourth coffee

I will have to silently destroy you

Multitasking
Ahh

Yes
We should play Civ
We could also keep playing civ
No problem

Ah I dont think I can do today. Friends wanted to do something later tonight
Or soon
@everyone short notice but you guys want to go to level one or something today
wow ergonomic
It's some fancy stuff
I can make it a standing desk or a relaxing desk
And it tilts
My desk goes up and down

yes
Many what if questions
People very often worry about things out of their control
its out of your hands
so why worry?
You cant do anything realy
I mean
in any ailment
you have a very positive attitude at least wwhich is the first step to recovery
Heheh yeah more time to play Civ I suppose
Cant do anything about it, besides not worry. Best way to not worry? Play civ :p. Perhaps when you two are off work and briana is back
Yea. Body takes time to recover on its own.
but in all seriousness hope it recovers soon
how generous of them
yes
they give you a week to live?
Most docs say give it a week anyway
Yea
I'm sure it will shoryly
perahps it will recover
It if gets worse I may have to get it looked at
Ah well
Shit dude
Knee still hurts. Have to walk that leg strait, because if its bent slightly my leg gives out on me.
Lol
What
damn even if i get 100% in all my remaining class i can only get normal cum load
Cum load

That's even worse than I thought
Jesus
Lmao
i guess yo dont need that ligament? lmao

damn
And stuff
Slicing open your wrist
The surgery for it seems horrible
Oh shit that's my nightmare
my hands still hurt lmao
and i swear i developed like sudden onset carpal tunnel
I was playing bass last night with Nate and his bandmate who were jamming
Ahh
Public Service
PSPC
What was the $13 job
Because it was 2017
Hahaha
Yep
and the year before that I was off the charts, $13.59
For uni under graduate?
last year
I got Uni Step 2 lol

It's funny because I'm not doing at all what my position says
hah maybe
the other 4
I see what you mean
Ohhhh
the steps repreesnt how promoted you are within that line of work
Nah so CR#, the number rempresents the kind of work youre doing
You cant promote outside those boundaries
So I'd start at 4 because I'm great
Kinda like the "promotions"
Ahh
Just gives flexibility for different skill levels, merit levels
No?
The steps arent nessecarily years
Unfortunately I won't even be here for more than three months
In four years I could make $51,518

503
03    Clerical and Regulatory (CR)
That's it!
Youre clerical
Like $18 an hour vs $24.50
Or maybe a little more than that actually but still
:I
The other students who will be doing the exact same work will be paid $10 less an hour
I dont think SD goes very high
some probably make way more or less
lmao
They told us not to talk about pay with the other students lmao
Ahhh
Its because they can only hire a certain number of things per year
I'll check
Computer resource or something
Like
Whats CR stand for
No other student will be
Thats pretty cool
For some reason
They hired me and my other friend as CR
Haha my friends are that
(Student)
SD6 second
Become CS1 when I get diploma
I was SD0 my first job
Hahah yep Fed Gov
CR4
My code is simple
hahah yeah
That's kind of fucked because they just assume you'll know to not work as much
but something else gross
Its not actually that code
it says 35 hours
and if you look up the gross code
"Pay Grade #@!)@#_BVR#@!N#P"
it sorta tells you but in a roundabout way
what my letter did not say was that im only being paid for 35 hours per week
lmao
Think of the experience you're getting
You're an unpaid intern didn't you read your letter of offer
Youre not going to get paid
and gross
Kinda scared that it doesnt show when ill be paid
Ie
All internal stuff is accessed through ke
Hahaha same
I cant access the pay system without it
The default browser is IE 11
I'm going to try
Just get a better gov job
Tru
I want to be given actual programming
I kind of am too but I also don't want to go back to retail
done
im already ticking down the days until this is odne
But I totally understand
hah
You're getting big bux for it man you can do it
I really dont want to do data entry today
Yeah haha and it works
have familiar things so that people liken it to the UIs they are used to
its probably all on purpose
Yeah it's the same colour I think
Just the heading
Atlas looks a bit like word lol
I like minimal
Lol it's kind of nasty
dark theme lol
oh yeha
You can change the theme to like mibinal then it's completely different
Maybe they legit just ripped it off haha

Or rather is unsaved
Even*

that implys you get a seat on the council
Ah haha
true but i can trade embargo you
😃
and you lose money if you do
it just goes away if we go to war
cant plundr it
thats why I make trade routes too you
and they get rekt
you get moooney for it
My fav tactic in war is destroying everyone elses trade routes
more so for late game
eh
and city is far
Its a bit hard when there are barbs
trade bois
yes
but trade routs
trade bois
raods are nice
I know what you mean though
well
no no
roads
it will QUICKLY level up
from a big city
and send it to the new city
if you make a caravan
also
to get your men up to shape
And ruin happiness and culture costs
they serve as good war bases
Late game new cities are useless
Yea
There is such a thing as spreading too thin
Its very effective up until a point
I love tall
you go wide
ah yea
many cities
Mine is eempire expansion
when I can pay for somone to do it
why go explore the world
I think my strategy is opposite to yours....
when I can buy one
why spend time building an amry
Greed is good
See
I always have a bit of everything so that I can never be thwarted
and your amry upkeep cost is cut in half
75% chance when you kill a barbarian they become yours
I kinda diversify
Yea one of their passives is like
Lol really?
if you were germany they would join you when you kill em
no fucking barbarians
I just like being stable lol
I like me money
Spider army
I think he likes really fucking big armys
Flash back to PA
Fin just loves nukes
Lmao
"Negotiate THIS!" *nukes a city*
"Politics is for the weak"
Yea fin loves war
ok
Yeah I'm gunna fucking die lol
1v1 is like
more people to kill the better
no more people is way more fun
prepare for destruction
yes
Unless you want to 1vq
I can play my dudes
Even just the two of us would be nice; like old times
Sure thing
Well ill finish my chore now so that ill have time later
Ahhhhh
so you had to group to and got nuked
was guarded by city states
that like
I think the only way to reach me was a cannal
You were like way up north barely connected to the land i think, that or on your own island
I know you've beat me donw early game before
that was one game that went on really late
and I think it destroyed you as britian
then i remeber nuking your subs
but yea I pulled a nuke out of my ass and blew up your navy
I know I did have stupid production end game
No I think you can
Ohhh
but maybe you cant
I sware I bought it
I think you built it in like 1 turn with your massive production
Just secrely packing
you kept very quiet about it
and yeah i was so suprised you had a nuke
a whole nuke for your navy
Dont think i ever won that
Although you always beat me at endless legends
when it got late
I remeber nuking your amry one game
You quit once i went aggro
And hah you never did
I have aabout an hour that I need to read over something to send to my dad, and them im free for the rest of the night
or fin and I could. Would like to kick your ass in it again 😉
Oi, now that Fin is back, we could all play Civ
lol
Its a good meme
I've been watching WW2 in colour and it makes me laugh
I feel Fin would like that one
Hahaha

*Shanky*

With a knife at the end

Maybe?
Weong

Its really hard to bend all the way
*shrugs*
Oh no.. I wanna say maybe try to like bend and stretch it but maybe not ..
have to wobble walk kinda
little swolen

No I like
And kinda fucked the knee around a little
Take a bad step
Like uhh

Did you go over on it?
Rip knee
And I can’t bend it all the way to pop it
No but seriously I think my knee is swelling slightly
No witnesses
Nice and quiet
Usually I go at like 2am
Less people. Colder
I usually go after dark
Midnight or so
Like
2am
Did you go shopping at like 2@?
It’s because I changed my scedualed
<@296572507241054209> you monster
It was fine before
It is
Lmao and it's Brianna's fault
It feels like it needs to pop but I can’t pop it
Also for whatever reason my knee is now killing me
Changed everything it did
Made me grab a basket
She ruined my whole week
Also it’s true what Brianna said
Yea! We can see about starting early or something 😃
It's a holidat
Also <@257986741896609802> we can probably start DnD early next Monday if you're free
I have to figure out how to make this

Beautiful
The sounds of the city
Haha what is this
"you'll/we'll have to blow away (resource)"
"(person) is chomping at the bit for..."
Lol
Why does every office person talk the same
I impeded on Sean's shopping routine and ruined his entire week

https://youtu.be/0W32e1rKCXw
And oh Susanna
He sang it 😂
Tipperary is from ww2 but
Well
Like nursery rhyme songs
He used to sing us all those old type songs
Song!
or catchphrase
is that a song or poem
On my arm
Gonna get 'its a long way to Tipperary'
Yeah!!
thatd be neat
Been meaning to xox
Im probably gonna get a tattoo for him soon
vry sad
Aww that's terrible
she*
who were long dead
He was calling for her parents
She didnt even remember my gma, her daughter
Yep me and my nanny
he remembered you?
Even when I wasn't there
He kept calling for me :(
It is very hard
its really rough on close ones
my great grandma was that way
thats alwasys hard too
My poppa ended up being delusional in the end
That's terrible
Oh my god
Mums in remission, uncle (her brother) just diagnosed with Stage III lymphoma
my 3 grandparents (never knew the 4th) are all very old, one with prostate cancer
Nooo that's terrible
thats actually a great apprehension of mine
not looking forward to the day
probably will
the tragady
what if it all hapens at once
oh no
and my dog and cat are past their life expectancies
especially since 3 family memebrs currently have cancer/remission
It is terrible
i have not been through loss yet, so thats going to be fun
ah sorry for your loss, that sucks
It's been almost a year
But like
I mean I realized
My grandfather actually died like,, last year I just realized
aw geez rick
lol
oOoH YoUr mOm dIeD
Pls mock oooh your mom died
eMpAtHy
pls mock empathy
Not true for everyone
Depends on if you have
Obviously that's like
A death of a close family member
I think they say it takes 3 years to truely accept like
just lets you live with it
of course its sad, but when you get through grief you learn to live with it, you accept that thats they way things are now, doesnt nessecarily make you happy about it
Maybemaybe
youll realise that
Thats a different sadness than grief
But it never stops making you sad
celebrate the fact that they were there in the first place
its very healthy
you can accept that they are gone
NO!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah you can miss them but not have grief
aCEptANce
You always miss them
just need to get to the last stage
When someone dies
I mean like
if youre bad at it
Some grief never goes away
you can escape your feelings through the 5 stages of grief though, and through time, time cures all
😂😂
hesitant laugh
hzhzh
You can't escape
👁 👄 👁
you cant escape
You cant escape your feelings
Just remeber
Did Sean follow u around and suck on ur pants
❤
Oh wow
I can never eat him now
Or it will swell and get infected and shit
Ive looked him in the eyes and bottle fed him
and im emotionally attached to shon
It NEEDS it
A cow NEEDS to be milked
lol
Dumb
Yuck
No
also veganism is dumb lets just put that out there before anyone gets any ideas
DIS guStin
thats why you just dont get emotionaly attached to anything : )
I refuse
Me neither
ESPECIALLY if you bottle fed it
i never eat veal
yeah
Especially a wee baby :(
I don't think I could eat a cow that I looked in the eyes
its the foodchain
its a bit sad, but i feel like youd have to come to terms wiwth it
you can be a farmer and still love for your animals and still eat them
you realise thats the way of life
lol yeah, or maybe opposite
I think being a farmer would turn me vegitarian
Noooonono!!!
and chickpeas
i guess ill just eat fish now
ahhahah ruined
mmmmmm
Thats a 4 piece nugget meal
Noooo
:I
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/565663569132257283/578043240813690880/image0.jpg?width=530&height=943
now go look at those nuggets
Best snack
Chicken is the best
I like it sometimes
chicken though.......
Me neither
He was my little pal :((
i dont really like beef anyways
I refused
I didn't
prob not
idk if i could eat it
hahaha
The farmer gave us the meat tho <8'D
thats just how it be sometimes
Yeah :((( he got butchered
and friendship, but very expensive friend
useless except for sperm, riding, or eating
I named him and I I'd visit him and he'd suck on your fingers
big bois
tough to look after
And unfortunately, he was a bull
I had a cow that I really liked at a farm I used to visit actually
although a few from it are still skiddish
yeah its a really friendly breed
They have little personalities
but its their breed, not from socialisation
Awww
theres two that will hop into your hand though
and still they hate being handled
and we have been handling them every day
born
You cant tell the sex when they are bron
and we couldnt even eat them, we made stew for the dogs
That would make me too sad
and he used the hatchet
we were only able to kill the males last time because my dads farmer friend from ohklahoma was staying with us
Hatched
Or
Instantly as soon as it's born be hand feeding it and stuff
You'd probably have to like
....but i mean you could?
very very very noisy
very
And they are very very noisy
they arent very friendly
And hah not really no
Likely going to give away males though
Could you?
And I don't think you could really keep a rooster as a pet probably
Cant tell what their sexes are yet
Keep the females for friendship and eggs
Yeah :(( that's true
(cock fighting)
dreams crushed
If you keep more than one male they fight
Nooo
Wha-
we may not have the heart to eat them though.... so might give away to local farmers
lmao
and eat the other half (males)
going to keep half (females)

Woah!!
:O!!
nop
U guys gonna sell them
They're so cute though
Awww ☹️
Except one is semi nice
theyve always hated it 😦

So they won't want to be held and patted then
Can we come and visit your chicken aw
they are out of the nugget stage though
Fiiiiiinnn
.......
all colours
Aww!!! Omg like little fluffy yellow ones?
babies
What!!! You guys have 19 chickens!!
I think this is the person that gives chickens golf balls
We have 19 right now
http://chickenkeeping.tumblr.com
:( poor chickens
and went broody
YEah, our silkies had a higher chance of hormone imbalance
Life fluffy hens ?
Broody than others
There are certain breeds tho I think right? That are more like
hmm
it has to do with their hormones being off
Ooh!! But aw that's sad, I follow a blog and sometimes she gives her hens golf balls
its not common that they go broody on unfertilised eggs
:O
and we didnt at that time, we have young ones now
they are confused and think they are fertilised
Did u guys even have a rooster?
Its sorta an accident
"hens may not even need eggs to set on to be broody--they may brood in a nest with no eggs. Or in a corner on rocks."
Oh noo, poor girl why do they go broody anyway?
We had to keep kicking her out of the nest
it was bad
We had one that went broody, but on unfertilised eggs
yes...
Starve themselves to raise their golf balls
waiting for the eggs to hatch
.......
they will starve themselves
You dont want them brooding, because they dont leave the nest
you really dont want that
and no
Then they complain a bit, but they only get broody when they are fertilised
U can like.. replace them if they're really upset right? Like with golf balls and stuff?
And no they dont unless they are broody
I think sometimes
this has been going on for so too long
Do chickens get mad when you take their eggs?
Making everyone think that their poops are eggs
Chickens are crafty
8O
plot twist it wasnt an egg, it was just poop shaped like an egg
No
:I
But an entire egg of poop
A little poop... That's okay
lil too much
yea
It's mostly fine but..... That was too much poop to sell
oh nooooo
I found an egg that was basically half poop
One time tho
oh boy
It'll be finedd
I'm just gonna ignore it
I found an egg with a lil bit of poop on it
:O
glad to hear it
hahah nice

I survived <@!331154975457673228>

Hahaha
he owns the tractor, then right away takes himself out of that next line lmao
He doesn't want to own it
new tractor*
As if he wasnt talking about himself anymore lmao
he describes it as "All that fucked stuff that goin on in hollywood right now"
then "Cheated on my baby and you can go and ask her"
And he describes that as himself, being in a high place loving life doing well with a new bladder, but not endorsing lean
It goes from "Riding on a tractor, lean in my bladder"
ON Genius when he describes the lyrics
It's a classy song
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Thats fucked up lol
Yep lmao
thats actual lyrics
"cheating on my baby you can go and ask her"
this is awful

It's in spiderverse apparently!
Ill check out post song though
Ah alright. We will see closer to the day
I like Sunflower - Rex Orange County
I might still be able to make it in tho
Ahh
Nooo no I just have a doctor's appointment
Ohhh, long weekend?
Also! @everyone may 27 Monday May be a day where we have to *possibly* cancel d&d
But it wasn't near as fun as ur dream concerts
I recently had a dream about the song sunflower by post Malone
We literally sing and dance together all the time 😂😂
I still can't get over the accurate representation of my sister and I that's so funny
Hahaha that's so funny
Its one of the funnest concerts ive ever been to and it was a dream
lmao
I'm glad I'm a talented rockstar in your dream universe
That's cool
I know that song
YES
You and Brit did the background singing (Ahhhhhhh, yaaaaahhhhhhhh, etc.), and the "Loft"s, but you did it softer. Nick did the male parts, and the band girl did the "My daddies got a gun" stuff
Sweet
I think I've heard it! But I'm about to do a really quick errand so that's gonna be my walkin song
Literally that's just an accurate representation of me and my sister
You give the song a listen?
That's scarily accurate to real life
It was awesome
Hahahah
Nick and I singing with my sister
Which one, the one with you and nick singing? or him being blackmailed?
Hah
That dream sounds like a preminition
Finn I gotta be honest
he has it. The choices you made in your impace his
a week later
you have a dream about nick being blackmailed
not nessesaraly at the same time
but
shared
what if all dreams were comunal
In a connected dream
But maybe it was me
I can't remember my dream from that night
Lmao maybe that was me
*duh duh duh*
lmao
whats if thats life rn
kinda spookily close to independant thought
he thought he was dreaming
but what if he wasnt
LIKELY he was just a made up concept by my brain
I kinda worry for poor apparation version of nick in my dream
the others fade
and if any of us wake
we are all dreaming
both were true
and what if
sometimes. not often
also do you dream?
wait am I an aparation in yours or are you an appartion in mine
DUH DUH DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
hahah shit
thats right now
what if
like i took the time to think for a second about whether I was dreaming or not and came to the conclusion that I definitely wasnt lmao
heh
im actually sorta blown away by that lol
WHAAAAAAAAAAA
WAHHHHHHH
fucking total inception
He thought I was an apparation in his dream, but in reality he was an apparation in mine
thats weird
haha
I was convinced I wasnt dreaming hahah
Isnt that fucked?
and I told him "Im not dreaming, so I highly odubt you are, haha"
and he was pinching himself
is that in the dream, nick asked me: 'You think im dreaming right now? This is too fucked to be true"
most funny part of it:*
:
the most funny part of it"
was pretty spooky lol
interesting sensrio
And I respected his wishses
I was trying to convince Nick to call the cops, but he didnt want to because in the dream he had illegally bought controlled substances from him, which led to the compromised bank info
Some guy from our highschool (who I havent seen in 4 years) got a hold of Nick's bank info and  withdrew $81k that he had for some reason, and threatened to "expose" him for his supposed "sexual" relationship with him. I think he had somehow obtained a dick pick or something as collateral too, to make it more convincing
whath append in that dream
di he now?
I don tthink I told Shon, but the other night I dreamt that Nick got blackmailed lmao
you were rocking the male vocal part
Hahaha i like that song too
this is the song for those who dont know
https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZPw5uyVI5m1nSvjQYmf3j
You guys were having a blast on stage
time
It was actually one of the funnest dreams ive had in a long itme
Hahah I fucking wish
its true
That actually happened last night
You didn't dream that
Lmao
you were doing the male lyrics, and brianna and her sister sang some of the female lyrics and the "Loft" part hahahah
and randomly it was suddenly you and brianna up there with them
I was at a concert and they were covering Hayloft - Mother Mother
this time, instead of you being blackmailed
With you in it hahah
Nick I had another hilarious dream last night
Not a huge fan of curry's, but I gotta admit that one sounds good
Cool!
And hahah its Butter Chicken curry
that way I can grab my laptop too
Sure thatd be awesome
Want me to wait for you fin? I can just walk over with you
mhmm... What leftovers were they? Im imagining leftover lasaunga me mum sometimes makes
yes
they are far to valuable
cant let leftovers go bad
I forgot my leftovers at home so ill have t orun home before bussing out there, (dont want them to go bad)
Hahaha
Worst case senario I sit at the buss stop waiting for you two :p
Should be back around 5:30-6
But I'll be meeting with <@331154975457673228> around 4:30 then we will bus to my apartment
Alrighty
6 should work
I'll have to let you know a little closer to the time as i can't say exactly when I'll be home
Oi nick, want me to be there are like dead on 6, a little after 6, before 6, etc? What time should I show :p
Alright, im ready for tonight. I took a small look over your sheet Briana (For your lil gob) and he seems understated acording to point buy. We will talk about rolling vs pointbuy for stats during the sesion. Anywho, ill take a detailed look when we all sit down tonigh.
hah
hahahahaha
“No more skinninggs or beatings. That’s old us. We are like, totally different now. “
“We had smoked way too much shit. We are good people now, sware. “
They say “yea level 1-4 was like... the bad time for us”
The party has regretted many of their early actions
shameful
skinning kobalds
AS THEY SHOULD BE!!!
Later they were like “holy shit we skinned somone”
and he watched these HEATHENS skin his FRIEND
it could have been that kobalds pal
At the time they thought “oh cool dragon scales”
they skinned another kobald
I mean
this is horrible
why do people do this
Oh yea haha
I think I remember
and he had a goblin and cut off both of his legs when the fight was over
Poor thing wanted the party dead... becuase... they skinned another kobold. Yea...
when we had danny hibbins play with us
remember
>8O
Ah, but it was too late at that point
until u force him to like u
patting kobald and feeding him
incorrect!!
But I do try to make combat not boring when it comes up.
Then sometimes they have a scuffle with a kobold and there is noting big; hitting it is the fastest sulotion. :p
And I’ve done my best to ensure combat is actually enjoyable! One of the big things is sometimes there may be gmic to the fight (that can’t be solved with “it hit it”) that will turn the fight to your side. Basicly a puzzle. My players have found they try to keep an eye out on other players turns to peace together the clues to ensure victory.
They tried their best to spiece it up. Just more things the players control means longer combat.
Well, if your a summoner, it’s basicly always your turn. Or one of your characters turns.
im surprised you didnt almost have to like... veto that
ohhhhh my gooooodddd
Combat went from like 15 mins to an hour for a big fight, to like 1 hour minimum, 4 hours for a big fight :p
i find combat incredibly boring if im not the one doing anything x-x
nooo
oooooh
It slowed combat down like 5x
I had a player run as a summoner
per character
40 characters
Oh no
im the dm
theyre both summoners now
.........
Depending on how it is, either one of them could use the sidekick rules, (nice that they have em now) or possibly due to there only being 3 of you, if you wanted you could run two characters. Just don’t make one a summoner or you’ll have more to keep track of then me! Hehehe
go brianna keeping documents
my level one sheet for Gwin!

oh!
back then they didnt
they have actual rules now though
to help me with like certain checks and stuff
and for combat what i DID do with my other dm (yen) was i got to use the sidekick like..... once per day?
Heh, I can understand.
i like playing two characters because its fun for rp purposes
That’s all for session 0 to figure out 😃
Yea, you’ll all be level 1. But you can copy that and edit it. True, you might decide something else.
IF i even use him
oh yeah thats fine gwin will need to be completely redone because he's level 3
It’s a good base that I’ll look at in depth. I’ll have to inspect it but if it all works out then yes. Otherwise, you’ll just need to make some tiny tweeks if I managed to find any errors. It should be fine though
better than starting from scratch
Ah well
toss it
might save me time
Sauce?
specifically for glith
sauce any of this over
can i just like
It’s part of the stuff to be done for session 0
Neat little sheet. I know when we all meet, I’ll go over character creation (even if ya all know it) just to endure it’s all well and done.
but maybe finn would have a printer he seems like the type who is responsible enough for that
this is just so satisfying to look at
i selected a font that went well with it
UGHHH so sexy


That could work. But yea, maybe fin has a printer? We don’t :p
8O
i wonderrr
actually
easy and easily printed later
put the sheet into ps and then just make my own text boxes
ill like
i have photoshop thats what i use
But sheets make it nice and neat
its annoying but possible
Or just pen and paper
I mean it’s possible to use something online but
because we do not
Does anyone have one?
to print the sheets
Yea
Something somone should do
anyone have a printer
Oh!
does
Hehe
. . .
i need to prepare all day
yahhh!!!!
But yea tomorrow we got dnd 😄
Mike (I think that’s his name) if my fave character after episodes 12-13
x6
I went to bed too, watched some breaking bad. Just finished season 3
Hey that’s fine, life happens :p
also <@!257986741896609802> sorry we didnt play civ nick and i were out doing errands for most of the day then by the time we got home he had to go to bed for work
well just heard wailing mostly its been like FUCK
like wailing
screaming
i keep hearing like
Venice the menace will have his way
With or without the others. Just a good old match, like the old days
Also fin we gotta play civ some time.
So if it’s near him it has to be near me
Well nick is litteraly a 5 min walk away
Haha nearby to your place? Huh
And yes so am I
Also aparently there is a very good pizza place nick orders from nearby. I am excited to learn what it is lol
Looking forward to making it a routine
I’m excited too
Sounds good!
I think character creation won’t take too long
It will be session 0, or 0.5. Session background, character creation, rules, etc. If we have time, it then becomes session introduction with the beginnings.
I am excited for tomorrow
Hahah good vid
This last episode killed off a bunch of main characters though..
Final season has been off the rails for plot and realism
Yep exactly
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cJFjLoiSOc
at least thats what ive heard
when characters where in impossible situations and died
so people got upset
people die
GoT is ment to be you DONT survive

<@!331154975457673228> <@!257986741896609802> want to play the 10 year anniversary mc map

Unfortunately still in Renfrew
cute pupper
and aww
Also if you two are still up for it when you get back, Im good for some Civ at some point

Hahahaha
I have never plant before
I am learning so much about plants
You get it as close to the light as possible as it sprouts its first real leaves
Ah ok. So how do you stop it from doing this? or it just is unavoidible?
Yeah it falls over
and I see what you mean. Why is it bad to grow a long stem? hard for it to sustain itself? fall over?
Ayy finished my sesion
The first one has barely any stem which is perfect
It's when the stem of the plant gets really long as it's trying to get closer to the light
https://i.imgur.com/uCkiAWd.jpg
Im not aware of what that means; whats streching in this case?
But that's ok
This guy's stretching a bit though not sure why. They were placed as close to the light as the other

Not a single bit of stretching this time around

Sure!
I can play tomorrow though
I’m at family dinner in Petawawa
Thanks, see ya!
Seeya
Have fun with it dude!
Yeah, I figured you wouldn't be able to play

To see how the fire is doing
I've left the beta vesrion going on the background
also beautiful video
oh yeah
and fire could only break a bock if so many sides where surounded
Oh I reember when there was no neatherrack
Reminds me of this
fire was stressful back then
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ajyreoLkHE
An entire tree is covered in fire in like 3 seconds
nope and it goes fast
it just dont stop does it

more realistic
yea
If anything
It's more realistic
I kinda like it better this way
Yep

like it would only go out if the block it was burning was despawned
I think it did not time out right
Fire was just brutal back then

rip forest
This entire forest is burning down
Fire spread
Oh baby
I see
the very first beta
In beta at least
It falls off of them when you hit them
That's what I remembered too but noppe
I always remeber having to kill em
https://voyagenation-biegalskillc.netdna-ssl.com/voyages/E/East-Coast-Trail-La-Manche-Newfoundland.jpg
For some reason I remembered it as you had to kill them for it
I forgot that hitting sheep used to give you wool
Also ooooh
Hahaha
I dont see any problems
https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/-/media/travel-stories/things-to-do/hiking-walking/five-great-fall-hikes-in-newfoundland-labrador-2.jpg?la=en&hash=CB77C5719DC86F564491ABED2E455C892BBBFF61
hey thats fairly natural man

hum

there are a lot of 0.31 versions
rip :/
I get a black screen on that vesrion 😦
Oh shit that's cool
floating islands
version 0.31 of MC
https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/minecraft_gamepedia/thumb/2/28/Indev_0.31_2010-02-03.png/800px-Indev_0.31_2010-02-03.png?version=01be1198ca09b2eb0673755cb649a619
Yea
Aether
Or
do you remember the aeror mod
you need modded if you want that
they also in older versions had floting islands as a world type you could pick. I love floting islands
ahh the days when the texture pack button said "Mods and Texture Packs"
Lmao
and hoping for the best
also smelting was at one point just throwuing an item into a lit fire
I think it was changed
When you take damage
Did they remove the steve grunt
I just realised
lol aparently arrows creafting recepiy took a whole iron ingot to make an arrow or something
that, if the target survives the arrow damage, is healed around 2 hearts
you can have arrows of healing
Oh that’s right
in the current MC
I remember your book
you can put potions onto arrows
did you know
also
and when I say wee little tot I mean like 7
Oh that's cool
Ah yes. Herobrine
but to put it simply; it was orgininaly the "bad guy" my mind made up for a story when I was a wee little tot. They evolved into a much more serious antagonist in the book I need to write one day. Regardless name stuck and its what I use for online 😛
Herobrine

Hahah
Looking all over
In this version of minecraft it just has a ton of steves running around
LMAO
KNAI
Sure
Hahaha
Maybe I can tell yea one day
thats a really really long story
How did you come up with the name zinthow btw
Hahaha
so I had to use Zinthow0 😛
Hahah
so I couldnt use my real username
Best $20 I ever spent
linked to Zinthowe
that was not real
I had like a glichy torrented version
because
I accedentily took Zinthow
Because
I know my Minecraft name is Zinthow0
Hah
And even that one is from 2011
I made a new account a while after playing because I hated my username
Same
not much, just a bit. I really got into it later, in like... 1.7 or whatever
Haha
Yeah, I started playing end of alpha
I remeber playing it a bit when there was only 1 tree type
Yeah dogs were brand new i think
Or like dogs or something
this is "can i even get it to launch without an error"
I think I started playing when they added birch trees
the VERY first alpha
The rendering is glitchy
its like
It's just flatlands
haha figures
There's no gui at all
it's a buggy mess lol
or the download is broken
like a buggy mess to play?
yeah it's pretty broken
wait nvm
Lol
The very first alpha is broken
I found out hwo to play old versions
I asume you can find them somewhere
Rip
what the hell they didn't just kill off every alpha and beta version did they
huh
You can only go back to the first full release game
wait wtf
*until you are at current day MC*
*this continues, seeing all the new features and getting excited for them*
I want to plkay that
I'm downloading survival test now
Lmao
"Skeletons can enter 1 block holes."

Its made for woman apparently
shanky
only true use for a knife
Yeah! I stab men with it

Every time I see them
I want to punch all of these buildings in nepean

they sometimes just give up and dont even build sidewalks

He doesn't even care about money anymore it's just power that he wants
Season 3 really shows how much of a control freak he is

pls fight <@!257986741896609802>
you need to provide a valid user ID or name to fight against lol
pls fight
You could have 2 vollys; first volly, then they kneel, then the back volly. Then everyone had to reload, and it was a fucking hassle. normal people would take close to 3-5 mins to reload, army could get it down to 1-2 mins
Until one person is knocked out
Lol that kind of war is like a fight where each person takes turn taking a swing at the other person
so it looked like turns
And maybe one side wanted to get a little closer to be more accurate
yeah, but everyone would shoot at once
Not really take turns, so much as realoading took 1-2 mins
with muskets
Im pretty sure there was literally a thing where they would take turns shooting each others army
Then the amaricans showed guirilla warfare/cover with chaos is increadibly effective.
The art of war has changed much. I know when they lined up, they were not in range of eachother, and it was an efficent way to get orders across a large army
We are savages
It slike the hilarious wars in the 1700s where they would line up and take turns shooting at each other
Clashing of ideologies. The is common deccency we can agree on so we are not savages; no one wants to be a savage (or be ruled by one) but there are thing we belive we need, and others dissagree, so fighting is inevitible
whether long and slow or short and quick
Killing is bad no matter what
Jeff
You can't stop that
Why not agree to just not kill each otehr at all then
Fucking jeff
Whoever the fuck Jeff is
Same with killing medics. The person you shot cannot fight; by the time they recover the fight will be long over, probobly the war too, they are down for good. The medic cant kill you and wont. You are wasting ammo by shooting them.
Unrelated but Jeff owns nuclear weapons
https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RLK89CoXdnSD4umj5q3CjA.png
Just like everyone has basically agreed not to use nuclear
Yeah I guess it's basically a bit of an Agreement
I understand rules to war. I did think about that before, but the rules are there as a means of "This is an unessesary and not even effecent way to kill people. Its just tortue. I dont want to have it happen to me, and I dont think you want it to happen to you; lets not do it, ok?"
Humans kinda suck lol
and nature
And yeah it's true
Humans are horribly good at killing each other
if you can agree to not kill each other in a certain way, then why are you even killing each other in the first place if its not all just a game
Napalm and nuclear bombs
Unending fire.
Up there with Napalm
Its probobly one of the worst weapons of war ever made
rules to war is a fucked concept
lol
Apparently
Italy was the first to say fuck it and used it again
Just everyone said "Dont ever use it, its too crule"
and fucks your lungs
Makes you go blind
Mustard gas is chlorine gas
Then it became a war crime
and it was forbiden afterwords
WW1 at the end I think
WW1
It basically suffocated you
When was mustard gas introduced?
Mustard gass would have been horrible to experience
yes by death toll, but not the highest percent
Yes and no
\
WW2 deffenetly has the largest deathcount, I feel WW1 had the worst ways to die
The Russians got fucked the hardest
World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total deaths ranging from 70 million to 85 million
Their training could make them just break down. Some of them could have been too dehumanized, but have control atm. *shrug*]
The world wars are mostly out of memory nowadays
Everyone was still horrified by WW1
Oooh that's true
I dont think they have been around long enoguh to see the real long term impacts it will have, like WW2 vets and PTSD that came from war
Modren military forces have been trained efficency. I think that the USA SEALS are like incredibly efficent killing mechines due to their training. They are basicikly walking bombs.
And in Hitler's case fuel your military with meth
You gotta teach your military to dehumanize the opponent
Watched a shit tone of it when I was young
I just love history
Hahaha
I love the world wars

In modren times the military has trained their military to be able to take lives. Something like 85% of them shoot when the time comes, and most hit their mark
It's pretty interesting
I threw on WW2 cus I was bored but it draws you in fin
Hahahaha
Its either watching WW2 in colour or auston powers
I don't think I would be able to
Most people cannot bring themsleves to take another life
Jesus
and those that did, only about 20% of them hit their target
that close to half of all combatants in both wars never fired a shot
Which should have been a sign from the start
I think I read somewhere
He fucking loved it
Yeah I heard that
Hitler survived the first war. Aparently he was egar to fight, disturbed his peirs
Yea they were efficent.
And some people had to fight both wars
Yea WW1 treches would probobly by the best way to visual a litteral hell
And you're dead
WW2 was more like one second it's cool the next second Germany has overtaken your entire area
That's fucked
you needed to use your foot
and rotting cavalry which they for some reason thought would be good to fight landships
I think most rifles were too big
I think I would have shot myself
fear of being hit and mustard fog rolling in
with limbs rotting off
Being stuck in mud all day long for months while being bombed and shot at non stop
shit flying through the air
And yeah WW1 was fucked
being stuck in those trenches for so long
Spain, italy, Japan and Germany were all cunts
I feel WW1 would have been more tereffying
Definitely
and a lot of shit that went down through them
there was a lot of build up to both wars
haha
52 minutes in and war hasn't even started yet
WW2 was complicated
I started watching WW2 in colour for no real reason
hehehe
Thank you master

I know he didn't cheat in sevtech bc I remember him spending ages using the stupid grindstone in the primal age lmao
hah fair
Yea. I just feel that If he every does anything by himself in a game im in with him, I will always think "But did he legit do it? or did he cheat?"
so that explains why im the only person who trusts him lol
The serpent
The hydra
We defeated the Ur Ghast
Only a few TPs when graves are like bottom of ocean
Never cheated
Making large base
We beat several bosses
I played probably 250 hours with him in SevTech and it was legit an amazing time
for real lol
Would be a lot happier of a dude if he gave people reason to trust him lol
I'm not going to add him to the server
Yeah
Im not a fan of people who cheat; modding and stuff is whatever, but cheating just ruins everyones fun. Im -really- not a fan of people who lie and act like they are not cheating. I still remeber that.
I see.
that's the one
the "im totaly not cheating lawl" guy
yes him
That brat
Ohh
and who is the force vs object
the guy who ruined the starbound server way back
who is this dan
lol
An unstoppable force meets an immovable object
Lol
Also shon and dan
Ohhhh
Yeah but Brianna would stop playing
He has been extremely civil on the other one, like no grief etc
That wouldn't be a good idea
I almost want to invite him to ours
I feel really guilty that I haven’t been playing on Dans server
Haha rip
Food coma
I just ate lunch and now I’m super tired lol
Hell yeah

Yep
I'm in like a secret club now

Lol
The governments linkedin
You can join GCConnex
You get a PRI, gov accounts
I haven't even done an interview lol
Once you’ve had a gov position they all open up
I know man i'm pumped
Fuck yeah dude this is a huge in
You’re right
Ahhhh
Wow that’s awesome#
Apparently it can be less than 90 days
It mentions I can't work more than 90 working days
Or maybe I’m wrong

That’s like 70 work days
Yeah usually you get paid for a 90 day period
Oh really?
Just cause that’s not 90 days which is uncommon
My friend got me in completely unrelated to being a student
"Full time casual work assignment"
Huh
Nope, it's casual
Which would be different than a casual
Maybe they have you in as a student actually
And hmmmm
Very common in government
May 8th to August 30th
Yes
YYes
Contract
Is it a 90 day contact?
yeah the day before I start working haha
Glad u got it formalized
That’s sweet
Wow
Salary is $47,000 to $50,000 a year according to it
Got my letter of offwr
And was breeding then again
I killed most of them
Lmao
can you make more chickens, release half, then make more for me
holy fuck that's a lot of money
and 17k employees
City of Ottawa has a $4 Billion budget
yeah i got 45 xp
hahah
Oh no they're starting to die from overcrowding
Breeding them is basically an xp farm lmao
We made more chickens instead?
But what if
I have a stack of cooked chicken
Lmao we need to purge some chickens
FME?

FME is really cool
Hahahaha fuck no way
I had to dedicate 8gb of ram to the server to make it keep up with the amount of chickens
Oooh that is cool
Pretty cool
Power BI
Intuitive language for non experts to request visuals of data 
E.g. public washrooms by ward by funnel plot
It sounds like CS but it leaves me confused
Use of census data to generate environics analytics
Field data collection projects (traffic, pavement quality, trees, parking)
Open data and engagement platforms
What else is being shown off?
And see 3D models of planned developments
It would also give you info if you tap on stuff
lmao
City *
Pokémon go for Cory data
That's a really practical use for augmented reality
Helps finding stuff under snow
Reduce chance of digging in wrong place
Under roads and stuff
That sounds like a really neat idea
that's crazy
Projected onto real world
Developing phone app that has X-ray like ability to see pipes and manholes and data
Yes
the city of ottawa has an augmented reality team?
Jesus it’s cool
There’s an augmented reality team
"This is what you -could- have done with your life"
😦
It’s showing me the 9000 other better jobs at the city
This showcase is bumming me out
Hahaha I've never used one. And hopefully your job will be more enjoyable as you learn more
Can whip around trees
Like one of those easy zero turn mowers that just becomes an extension of yourself
Weirdly as trash as the trailer park was, there’s something relaxing about mowing the lawn on a ride on mower at 8am
From the moment I leave home I begin a countdown of how long it will be until it’s over
I wish I had a more enjoyable job lmao
I feel like my body is eating itself and it doesn’t taste good
I feel sick
If I don't eat I get sick
fuck lol
Nope lol
did you not eat?
I’m fucking starving holy shit
(GIS)
oh cool
It’s kinda like a work showcase for people to show off their work in the field
Or is it like a thing for all new employees or
SO it was like an event that they invited you to?
better to be early
It’s good, I came a bit early
Same building
Haha what's going on there?
Centrepoint theatre
City of Ottawa regional office
Good, I guess I’m technically across from the gonq
How's it going at algonquin
I’m at Algonquin
Bojack but realistic
Really good artist

Gave me the jeebies
It just looked....... Weird
No way if her father was that dark would she be the whitest person I've laid eyes on
dad

And if he's her step dad she looks way too old to need her hand held
possibility mother is white but
No resemblance at the least

Wow they moved it to 10pm
fuck yeah
Let’s do it
@everyone

door trafficking
its like our version of human trafficking
doors made by doors, sold by doors, robed by doors, and then bought by doors
its doors all the way down
Turns out it was all run by doors
expecialy the doors
And everyone loved it
"no. grey market"
"what should we call it? door maket?"
"lets start an illegal market just for doors"
ah yes
It's different from the black market because it's for doors
not the black market
I'll sell them on the grey market
They're nice doors !!!
its the only thing of value
I make away with your doors
blugend to death with icecream
Swing it around in the bag
Use my ice cream as a weapon
lol
now you can rob me
I'm gunna Rob ur house
Yes
mission accoplish
Perfect now I know where u live
Yesssss
8O
stay*
you will walk under me
to walk back
if you stat on this street
lol
>80 I didn't see u I was gonna wave and fortnite dance
gud
I'm gunna buy some ice cream
I saw you enter circle k
I do not see u yet
I am looking
ok look up at apartnments
Crossing the street
I am at the 4 way
I will indeed!!!!!!!!
let me know
when you leave the little k
mhmmm cookie dough
I want cookie dough
mhm ice cream
I want ice cream
Get ice cream
Should I actually go to circle k
the 4 way
when you get to the corsswalk
let me know
To wave at me
Begin preparing
Ill keep an eye out
ok
I'm walking home
Okay Sean
not sure whats worse in the long run
I try to be more gentle but have to do it several times
it always works
ty;er punches it
I can picture you and Tyler whipping it shut
And haha
I couldn’t get my food out unless I cleared the time or let t run out
it feels like its gotta be slamed harder each time
like
except
WHich wouldnt be a problem
Really bad
Okay that's like
Oh.
Like for a while
Ours wont start unless you slam the door really hard
Otherwise it's the best microwave I've ever owned
The one at the school just kept spinning haha
I don’t want to be irradiated
Only for a second tho
That’s terrible
Wtf that’s so spooky
Stays on when u open it
Ours does that sometimes
just add water
instant cancer
I felt like I must have instantly contracted all of the cancers
I remember when I opened the door on the RCI cafeteria microwave and it stayed on
Lmao
Only gives benign tumors!
Often
The ONLY reason Nick and I have those things are his grandparents
and it doesnt spark often
we got a microwave though
We have neither microwave or toaster here but we have that
It’s essentially microwave + toaster combo
It's good for like so many things
Ez and convenient
U should get toaster oven
😔😔
That’s just how mafia work sometime
so no cooked baggle
but yea no toaster
10 for me
but the buss gets there in 3 mins
Hahahah
probobyl 15 for others
for me its like 30 mins
Idk why so good
The big station near the uni is walkable
Warm fresh cooked bagel with jam
Oh man so good
They are delicious
Oh noooo
You gotta eat the bagel
so no bagles 😢
It's that easy to bus
we dont have a toster lol
Omg wait really
I have not had a bagle in forever
Yeah
Also
the one near the uni
so that has a lot of options
Yea. I know if I walk across the street again the buss gets to a buss stop in 2 stops
Short walk to stop is big plus
Pretty sure there are faster ways for you, but that’s likely not bad
Ohhh I see
downtown
I think maybe another
Towards downtown or towards bogie
the buss stop right across the streat from me has the 88
away form the apartnemtn
uh
Going where
I always feel like the only way out is the 88
It goes to billing’s bridge
88 works too but takes way longer
I forgot of other busses
It’s across from the loblaws
Im so used to thaking the 88
All go straight there
94, 95, 87
So is this kettlemens a shop or a baggle type in the lobbals
Or vice versa
From downtown
Pretty easy to bus to your place
Yess this is the direction I take for kettlemens
thats how I identified
Saw the random shit in the parking lot 😛
Bird was hanging out there
Yess
Hahahaha yeah we do
is that the home deepo in the background?
Lobbylaw
Just yesterday I made my bi-weekly trip to loblaw for a grocery run
Also I had no idea you lived at the baseline bus stop
I had to go to renfrew
😡
You didn't even come visit!
Waiting to be picked up
!!!!!
Sitting on the bench out front the Starbucks
Today
I was just in that parking lot earlier to fast
Don't want that at all
its birbs say to other birbs "eyy bb u want sum fuk"
I-
Oh
:O ! What

My life revolved around them for the longest time
Ok those were the shit
PVP last man standing servers on huge map
before fortnite
i used to play MC hunger games servers back in the day
haha I suck at them too
I've been carried to victory before lol
On solo at least
I've put a lot of hours into battle royales and have never won a single one
yeah it's super annoying
Never liked the idea of losing everything
I like them but get sick of them after one round
yeah fair enough
Ah, I have not been a fan of them
But a fun one
it's another battle royale game lol
I dont think so? whats that?
<@!257986741896609802> do you have ring of elysium
😦

Yea
I wanted to die the entire time
My first 9 hour shift at home depot was done with zero sleep
insomnia is the fucking worst thing
that sounds awful
fuck dude
no
is it intentional?
cant sleep
sometimes I uh
oh man
within 2 weeks
it may have been closer to 30
I have had like 4-5 2 day with no sleep
idk about 40 hours
I've stayed up 35 hours or so that way before
lol
stay awake for 40 hours
I've gone to bed ten hours before I need to wake up for something and then just stayed awake the entire time
haha yea sometimes I like
just like 2 hours laying awake though
but i usually do
it just takes me a lot longer to
sorta yeah
And can't
Do you have a problem where if you need to sleep you just don't
Haha you're not the guy in the gif?
not sleeping i mean
me tonight
https://i.imgur.com/q1AxJAT.mp4
otherwise I won't sleep at all the first two nights
I gotta fix my sleep schedule before I start working
sleep is the more valuabe part of the day
lmao
Pinned message is legit Danny devito

i sleep well in the cold
i hate them
lol
I like hot summer nights normally
got no air conditioning
I am but i'll probably regret that
not excited for it to be hot at night
And normally nothing is within walking distance in nepean
Definitely. It's within walking distance

He seemed to like getting pet

well most of the time if you pet him he purs and closes his eyes
they dont do it for pats!

Yea. He also will like, lay down on his back showing his stomach for pats right?
he just likes to know he can control people through pain
hahahahahaha

runs to the door to be let out

Alrighty.

Did that discription + atmospheric music help your decision making?
Also
rip serverino
Sad lack of mc server
Setting 3:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUJlk5YtOzU
Setting 2:
55% combat
15% exploration
10% jokes and memes
10% eldrich horror
5% serrious busness
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSclJ-tjkYg
Setting 1:
40% jokes and memes
35% serrious busness
10% combat
10% exploration
5% eldrich horror
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg-h2s2wUKw
Also to get a %type and musical 'theme' for each setting...
There is a bit more info for you <@!331154975457673228>
Also, first setting has had some of their Favourit NPCs
But yea. The 1st setting was kinda funnyish, with some goofy plots but also some very serious plots. It exsists in the same world as setting 2, and a group I dmed fro only payed atention at really really endgame (level 17+) but they said it had some really stressful moments and hilarious moments.
2nd setting was one the other party finished. Lots of combat. Lots. But not just: "I roll 13 to hit, end my turn." No no... There were bosses. like from WoW. Mechanics to every fight. Every floor of the dungeon had a theme, and about 80% of the fights were against bosses of the floor, that all had a special gimic. Players loved the combat, one guy who had played DnD with others said I managed to do what he never thought was possible: make DnD combat fun *mechanicly*, not just RP wise.
3rd setting is the newest. Party has said it has felt "real" in the snece every characters motives make sence, why they exist is understidible, and eveyr action they do has weight in the world. Killing a stanger in the other setting was nothing. This? killing a bloody goblin made them feel like shit and -*ruined*- any their chances of partaking in an alience with the goblins (that they later wanted). With factions and orginizations to join, all having having very serious impacts on the world, the party has said it is increadibly depressing and stressfun; but they say its like heroin, they cant get enough.
...3rd setting is ALSO where they fought Cluk, the chicken god. So there is no shortage of humor either.
That be how swashbuckling works
yes
I'm 16 and only listen to music from the 1700s.
Sounds good!
When we all get together (perhaps monday nuight?) I can go over more detail
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF3JWJksP9I
Okay 3 is perfect for me then
Ahhhh
There is still the 3 settings. I know you'd like serious. And when I say 3 is serious and 1 is funny, I dont mean that its JUST that. I mean thats what to expect; but also expect seriousness in 1, and goofy moments in 3.
but I dont want it to dominate
Of course smatterings of humour are essential
I'd prefer if we do a serious one
Well
Hehe, thanks 😛
And what are your thoughts on our campaign?
Reminded me of your style of story telling...
and I was enthralled in wonder, and entranced in how rich he was able to make the setting
He read me an excerpt about a Dro / Dark elf who was comparing life in his underground village to that of the gnomes
My dad is reading his stuff right now, it is bloody excellent
Wrote 30 books in the 80s, which expanded the D&D universe 10 fold
Originator of much of modern D&D
I have not
Have you heard of R. A. Salvatore?
ALSO ive been meaning to ask you

Lotr is literally a fever dream no matter what you do
First time was before I watched the first movie and the second time was after I watched the first movie twice but didn't remember anything
And the second one like ........ Twice
I've watched the first movie like 3 or 4 times
that movie man
but
its on my "need to watch" list
that is still my only expirence of LotR
Fun fact
Hahahaha oh no
the headache and vomiting and passing out only to awaken to a new sceen did not help
it felt like a feaver dream
and I saw that
and I had no idea what they were
I remeber people talking about how great the LotR movies were
and my mum put that on for me to watch
I was home sick one day
when I was a wee little tot
I remeber
And the animation
Ngl I actually really like the art for it haha
this angers the fin
😠
There's the best Lord of the rings right there for u

Yes
😡

Waait

Is that a tinny purse?
Love bad dragon!

A dragon dildo? Yeah
What Nick got me

Lmao
Because even at that point it was outdated
ottawa
the phone I got off of ebay for pretty cheap
I have always had SHIT internet until like
Hahaha yeah
I had a flip phone til grade 10
Omg I love that
That he sold me
Or just 3
Hahahaha aww
My first phone was nicks 3G
Lady*
Lol
There's a fucking last in my lunch room and she keeps just making grunting and groaning noises and I fucking hate it here
I was very restricted
I would go to Matt’s to use his dialup in grade 5
I didn't really get to use the internet though
or 11
I had internet as a child but not a phone until like grade 10
I spent the majority of my childhood on the internet
Depends on where you live though
I mean I did not have internet until I was nearly in highschool
We are the last generation (of developed nations) to spend our childhood without internet
I can't wait to upload my conscieness to the world wide web !!!! 😫😫😫
Once our concisenesses are all uploaded it will be a human right
they're good to have yeah
Hahaha
Hahaha
<@136253782131474432>  which reminds me I need to get a VPN again
*all of your data is stolen*
"lol oops"
It's weird because WiFi is TECHNICALLY everywhere it's just shit and also you might get all your data stolen lol oops
Ah I guess thats ture. :/
Because most public places even have WiFi that's free to use
To have it in your home I think will always be a luxury :6
Perhaps far in the future it might be a right. For now it is, unfortunetly, a luxury
And I don't think that'll change :(
true true
It's a luxury to have it at home
True true but I think then they'll probably just say library
but in a way you're right
then it's a human right
if what doug ford says he's going to do with making online classes essential
It's "accessable" to everyone
And internet cafes
As shitty and annoying as it is there are libraries
As important as internet is I don't think it's a human right in the sense every household should have it no matter what
oof
Buying stamps
Hah
Horrible
imagine using actual mail
Real old fassioned
It would have to be a ma-and-pop place or something.
Getting a job would be impossible without email or phone
Well, in 1st world contries anyway
it's basically impossible
It feels like it would be -really- hard to get by in todays world without a phone or internet
But still
Yea, it is
Pretty sure water and stuff is more important
Sure
Some say it’s a human right, not see about that but it’s close
in reality the future will have corporations charging us for oxgin
I dream of a day where internet is free for all; just a basic nessesity
Yeah
Should be done away with
and yea its such a thing of the past.
Over in Europ they pay like 15$ for double what we would pay 65$ in ottawa
It’s completely arbitrary
Costs
It’s not like electricity where the more you use code them more
They should in this day and age
Bandwidth limits should be illegal
not so good
Oh wow
The bill is sometimes $500 per month
My dad would get me to pay like $100 if I downloaded something big
Ah well thats good
Hahah our internet is good now, but very very low limit
30 second lag fin 😛
Half way between bogie and renfrew at least hah
Awe geeze
Bogie
Lmao if it weren’t so cramped I could play on my laptop on my hotspot
When you say home, do you mean the old 'bogie home, or ottawa
I’m just on the bus now
I can probably play Mc from home
Alright
I just gotta drive brianna to work brb
lol it should be
it should be considering your like 5 houses down lol
is the ping alright?
weird
comming back
Got a crash
did you lag out shon
<@!331154975457673228> since you're home now you probably still can't play mc eh
It's a whole new game
I played a tiny bit
I havent played starbound since it updated
Rip
Also internet is randomy dying again
Or starbound
I'd be down to play it again
Terraria is also a game I'd be down for palying sometime, with or without calamity. Good progression game
he might be
we thought he might be a god. This only proves our succpissions
Where he was the ONLY casualty (thus far)
We fought Devourer of Gods.
Untill...
every damn time
he would survive
every time all of our NPCs got whiped out by a boss
Hahaha
But he never died
instead of died
the game says they left
when they "die"
yet they are a kid
looks down on you
who talks all high and mighty
There is an NPC in terraria
Funnily enough
Thats how mafia work
sometimes he devours gods
Just devours things sometimes
sounds like a chill guy
we are trying again. Beat her, are now dealing with "The Devourer Of Gods"
we never beat the mod
It gets crazy. Last time we played we got stuck on "Provadance, the profaned godess"
Damn yeah that sounds like wow lol
"Tyler, keep circling it and drawing agro. Andrew, dodge up when the fireblast is released, then imedietly doge left to get out of the shrapnal AOE. Ill take care of the ADDs he summons."
I'd almost say its more like a wow raid during boss battles
and eh... In the sence that you need to know what to do and not do to during boss fights, kinda
Yea its hella fun.
Does it make terraria basically dark souls
Sounds cool
Damn so it's a full game changing mod
its also nitoriously hard.
Its considered the largest mod for Terraria. Doubles the bosses, adds even more end game content, adds 2.5 extra difficultys, boss rush mode, whole bunch of stuff
Oh what's the calamity mod
been busy with terraria, the Calamity mod is hard as all hell but friends want to beat it
Oh hell yeah
I got some free time to play MC
Also <@!136253782131474432>
Oh boy
so I gotta make sure they didn't mess up anything on my end
have to contact correctional services because apparently they fucked up my friends fingerprints without telling him they needed to get another copy
mostly i know how to be a courteous tourist hahaha
i know a little more about their culture and how to behave in japan than i do like about their religion
thats neat i really like that
ok ok that makes a lot of things make a lot more sense
ooooHHH
Shrines are just places of worship
im having a very hard time fully understanding this i know the symbolisms because ive seen them in media and heard them talked about but
god = nature
worship their spirits?
oh so its like they like
jumbled
the wiki is a little
wiki prob better
haha
https://www.tsunagujapan.com/17-facts-you-probably-didnt-know-about-shintoism/
im reading the wiki page hahaha
spirits and stuff
the actual inner workings of their religion ive actually never really been clear on
and they have people that care for them but
they all have different meanings if i remember correctly ???
i mean of course the shrines have meaning
hahahaha
heheh
"is christianity just crosses n stuff"
like i know shrines are very important
but thats a part of it

lol no
just shrines and stuff
oh is that it?
shrines

Prosthetic boobs and butts
Due to their plastic bodies and oversized bionic eye implants

They are all in constant pain

<@!331154975457673228> I have a possible problem I really need help with

I'd be paying it off as it goes back up again
oh I know and that'd be hell
otherwise itd be like 20%
definitely
thats better
ahhhh
My mum put it on her line of credit

Killing the leader with the flag gives you a “bad omen” for many minutes, leading to more waves of attack, and leading to an instant attack on a village if you are at one
It's snowing outside
it is a problem indeed
too busy being raided
because we are bookpoor
with no books
and an enchanting room
Oh nice
we have a new entrance to the house

lmao
"please we are poor its our only one"
"give us back our flag"
But lmao that'd be funny
no I got it from one of the attackers
is that why they attack us

where they belong
I put them in the ground though

I'm not sure what a bell does
he can now craft us a bell
oh
when they level up they can make better things
and you level up them by trading with them
hu

Oh well.
It’s always a little annoying when someone says 1 hour before the session starts they can’t make it; the other people might have canceled things to make time for this. It’s just common decency to try and say in advance if you can or can’t make it, yea know?
Alas. At least this gives me time to do prep work or something.
Also looks like my other party won’t be running dnd today. Two people said they can’t make it
Oh
🙃
And that is almost racist and it's hilarious to me
Nick kept calling Guillaume guseppie

"This campagin is just your secret and hidden love for kaijus" -that one player
They have never entered the jungle. But the last 3 major locations they went to all had a huge fucking beasteal creature in it, so they think every location has gotta have one
Haha
somone bet him 50 of his gold that its gunna be a dino. The person who started it has his bets on a bee.
A giant bee may as well be a Dragon or something
Oh no
or a huge fucking dinosaur
mothron
he thinks its either gunna be a giant fucking bee
So going into the jungle
every large location in the campagin has 1 "kaiju" in it

true
But a sesion 0 is always good. Not expecting to play, just figure out what we are doing
but yeah make everything except stats on your own time
it took 2.5 hours the one time
oh nice
lol I know the book so inside and out it takes under 10 mins now
make characters on your own time
ages
also remeber when we made characters before and it took like 1 hour each?
and then make characters
I was thinking we woukld have a session 0; hang out and figure out WHAT session type we are doing
https://tenor.com/view/doorway-anotherplace-realm-imagine-imagination-gif-7348438
When we also all get together to figure out session
Cool cool
Yea that works
Want to do 12:30

realm
Anything can happen in the imagination
Would 12:00 tomorrow work? <@!136253782131474432>
board games are also hella fun
That said, as I am mostly happy with my own thoughts, creating wordls for others to explore...
Yes, thats how i see it.
Thats a good thing
*shrugs* I am content with little, and see no need to strive for more. Most would be unahppy but I require little material needs to be happy.
Is your life a grimdark?
I just wanted to run a grimdark setting :p
which if thats true... The world we are running is a very sad one. But, there is a beacon of hope within it.
Heh, interesting
One of my players thought that perhaps I am subconciously (or conciously, he thought) putting my deep thoughts into my DND campaign
But for people lucky enough to not have that, it can make you learn a lot about yourself
Really brings it out
Its really bad for people with stress, anxiety, depression, or psychosis though
I've tried too many things to count
:(
I have an exam tomorrow
Tried psycahdelic mushrooms once and it was.... something. I reccomend it to everyone (who doesnt have mental health issues) once in their life, but not more than that
and I have had one drink once (a fruity one) and it gave me a headache. Not enoguh to get drunk
Sure! <@331154975457673228> wanna come too
Before 4 tomorrow? I could come over
Drinking makes me feel good on weekends, but weed stressed me the fuck out hah
Yeah i peer pressured Nick into drinking the one time, but for the most part I am the same
Ok I'm free before four
Hell yeah
I have had a taste of intertesting board/card games and I need more
Oh yea! I'd friggin love that.
Btw I'm done school now so we should finish that star realms game
Yep :D
But at least youre better now
Ive heard it can do that.
All better now though
I got into hard stuff for a while and I messed up my life pretty badly
It was probably for the best
Haha I remember
Yea. I was anti-everything before 😛
Haha. I used to be peer pressurey but nowadays I respect people who choose not to drink or anything
Yea. So I dont care what people do, im just not one for doing anything myself. And i've always hated the taste of alchohol 😛
Yeah weed definitely has great medical properties
Oh Jesus
paralizes half of his body
And I see. My brother actualy needs to smoke weed, or he gets HUGE sezier migrains
My opinions have changed somewhat; I dont care what anyone does, so long as it wont kill yea/ruin your life.
And drink
The people remaining in the group now just smoke weed at worst
Ah ok
He got caught driving with an open beer and passing around a joint with a pound of weed and a sheet of acid and a couple speed (meth) pills on the floor
Is that how he got in jail?
Now I've heard he's selling heroin even
Kurt started selling both on huge scales
Half of our group got into cocaine and meth pills
thats it
I know you were into weed
Well
now I dont care
I know I was really agsint it before
None lol
Uh
Shon how much do you know about the shear amount of drugs that were involved with our group for a bit
Lmao those are better
"Recolections of Renfrew"
"Renfrew Recalled"
<@331154975457673228>
Let's write a book called the Renfrew Memoires
I love that you documented everything
Findlay you could write a book with what went on in our grouo
Ahhh
and I can limit what they see vs me
No, roll20 just makes it so everyone can see a screen
Do you use an app or screensharing for it?
Done a week from today
cuz once your done we can get a time to have our own DND session 😄
Also, when are you done classes <@!331154975457673228> ?
"I dont want to fight you. But you leave me no other choice; I do this for my people."
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpXNHYldIE0
For example: this song is for a character that wants to be allies with the party but if they cant agree then she -will- fight to save her people
I spend hours looking for good themes for encounters/boss fights. The song has to fit the personality of the character, it has to fit the theme of the fight, and it has to be good quality.
Noone has shit internet?
People are committed and plan it well?
Wow nice!
and easy to play music for every encounter
but I have accurate battlemaps and roll20 to calculat everything automaticly
and not realy. cant act out or point to stuff (I still do it even though no one can see me lol)
the group I have been with forever is 4 people large, the other is 5 people large
Thats interesting. Do you find it hard to do online?
Have not been able to do sesipons in person
Yep
both groups are now in setting 3, they both love it
Oh are they both online sesssion?
went from level 1-20
have been urnning a session for them for same amount of time
the other includes tyler and some friends I made online over like 2-3 years
one is people I dont know, they are new
and I run 2 groups
Ok cool
Legal Lingo Limbo
Ugh its impossible to read one section of an act without reading 10 more before it makes any sense
nothing is dated either
and its only first hand primary sources from you and Nick
Its missing a lot though
Some key events are in there

Pls send
What holy shit
@everyone
or at least part of it
Lmao apparently I was so bored at work last year that I made an entire word document documenting the history of the friend group
I cant stop procrastinating
But that's super annoying
I guess she can just work or something
Lmao that sucks
Lol Annie has to come back in the fall to do 1 single course to graduate lmao
flat 0
lowest possible gpa in it
sometimes if you dont show up to exam etc, they wipe any marks you have from course
which is a 0
but then after that it shows as fail
i think you can even half drop after that, like it shows up as dropped on your transcript
damn
I could have done it if I stayed
I was at the end of that time
You can drop classes fully (doesnt show up on transcript) for like the first 2 months
lol thats terrible
It's so stupid at Algonquin
I was even in line to drop but decided fuck thjs
I would have dropped so quickly if I could have done that
really? Mine you can drop or switch classes with two clicks at any point during the semester before like exam period almost
Then wait in line for like two hours
You have to go to an office and fill out a long complicated form
I wanted to drop my elective but they make it so hard to drop
and got kicked out
Haha fuck really?
so they just stopped going to classes but didnt drop lmao
on the portal i mean
that they were not even awware of their profile on the school website and like how to add or drop courses etc
I used to have friends who tried so little in school in second year
1.0
hah
1
My GPA is like
Eitherway
With the theory heavy classes
I feel like I wouldn't do so well in uni
And I got like low 70
way better than me
Some classes were hard
85 maybe
I have around an 80% average
But hahaha I know it does
Thats still not bad
3.4 is more accurate probably
x2
lmao
Im for some reason really curious, I feel like your GPA over time tells a crazy story lmao
Not good days
And yeaaah
It should be like a 3.8GPA at least but eh
Yeah i remember when you were fiending
My transcript is a mess
Wow!
But the damage is done
I redid it and got on the honours list
Wh
I stopped going
Second semester when things got really bad for me
nooo when was that
I have an entire semester of fails already
you could have just dropped haha
That shows as fail on transcript lmao
My GPA is fucked haha
Dudeeee
No :(
Hahah did you drop it properly at least?
I'm hoping they'll extend me without any issue but if not I'll do HD or something
I would yeag
I have one elective I stopped attending last semester that I need to do still. I might just take it next sem
Oh sweet, you may need to get extension then for the second 4 months
So I get the big bux

I had a course in uni
is the exam not worth much
that's good

I’ll pass the course for sure

The city is so beautiful in this game
Yep
And that's your computer
"The man colapses, your blade through his chest... but suddunly stands again, gritting his teeth. He looks at you, hold on by *sheer force of will alone*."
The wind blowing the wrong way will kill it

thats how I feel my PC is right now
"sheer force of will alone" is what I say to my players whenever something survives damage with 1 hp left
FUn fact
smug ass bastered
Me rn

By shear force of will alone.
Alive
Alice
How the fuck is it alice
for anywhere from 10 seconds to 3 hours.
the screen flickers rappidly (eveyr 2nd frame is black instead of coloured)
when I alt tab stuff
Also
the fan has run 247 for 3 years now
it shouldnt be
It more clunks now then clicks
Alive
I don't know how your computer is alice
Sometimes
Does your hard drive still click
Hahaha
but physicly its not
Having a hard time with jtself
No no the BIOS said its sitting at 80*
Or your computer is just
It might be because of dust
so the fan is always on
it just THINKS it is
its not
See my computer thinks its running at 80*
Ancient ones hahaha
what graphics cards were avalible in 2008?
and I do not
so its on all the time
and turning it on and off gives it problems
the fan runs 247
Lmao
Do you know what graphics card you have now
its constantly wheezing rn
We have an extra GTX 770
Im afraid if I touch it it will explode
Actually Sean I could possibly give you a graphics card that'd make your computer a bit faster
from when time itself had not come to be
Hahahaha
from when the ancients still walked the land
from before I came to renfrew
from when we land
is the same
my computer
I've spent too much money on my computer
I'm on ultra high graphics at 1440p
Haha
but I think if you dont have to its graphicly sound
Oh yea I had to turn everything to low
The graphics are very nice so far
oh good
you can just restart from last checkpoint
It fixed!
I hink in options
Restart might fix

maybe restart the level?
oh no
I'm having a hard time with this level because I'm inviisble still
That sucks
Hahaha
Had to restart the mission I was on lol
Hahaha oh no
unable to move
I just stood there
so there was no way to jump off
I jumpted to a location that you were not supposed to be able to stand on
What bug did you find
Hahaha
Here's Arno holding his pocket watch
Ghost child

I encounted 1 bug
dont know if it still is
I know when it came out unity was buggy as all hell
oh boy
And the boy is gone
Then the cutscene camera changed to a different angle
This little boy was here and his father talking to him
And
I'm currently playing
and then says "Yep you can. go ahead"
it actualy just checks to see if you could theoreticly play with huge chunks missing
Yea unity lets you play a game when you ahvwe only 10% installed
lol
But my game is actually still installing
Thought it was part of the game
lol I finihed the first level and it said installing
Oh yea
Lol you dying on the first level
what one?
Oh fuck that twist
Got it
citty returned
citty
Ah yea I couldnt get to settings before I was able to start moving
https://youtu.be/NWeyUpqnKuk
But it's thrown me into the game already before any kind of menu
I'm trying to get to a settings menu
oh ok
Also you'll be in a tutorial of a sorts until you reach reach notra dame or however its spelt. Once you see it your in the main game.
Never felt like they had X-rays or something. Though using guns will alert them
like "Ok if I stab that guy then that one WILL spot me, and he is being watched by the guy up there... but the one who goes on patrols enters a room by himself over here, so I can kill him without anyone spotting me"
I have not observed the AI too much in Unity, but I feel it does follow set rules. I always know when I will and wont be spotted; and if I am suprised its usualy somone I missed when I was scouting.
Like they have some kind of xray eyes
nothing annoys me more than a stealth game where the AI spot you from behind a bunch of stuff
I really like games that have good AI
not sure in unity. They are very perceptive I noticed, hard to sneak around.
but then again the AI while you were sneaking was dumb as a brick in 3
If you get spotted it was a fight to the death.
In 3 it was. Unity you can get back to being sneaky.
Like you can't even sneak away
that sounds like hell
and snipers can one-shot you.
In unity they dont climb, but they wont hesitate to gun you down.
they would just climb buildings and chase you, shooting you as they did.
So it was -really- hard to get away
in 3, they have guns. Ok, whatever... but they aslo for whatever reason climb too.
In AS 1 and 2 if you climb, you get away from ennemys unless there were archers on roofs
and yea, I played 3. I had a complaint for it that they fixed in Unity:
Yea same for me, love it too
I love ottawa man
49GB and playable in 5m
also
I believe so
with washington and stuff?
like the setting
That was in North america right?
I have it on steam but haven't even started it lol
I still need to play 3
After not playing an AS game for a while it feels like any one of em, fun for what it is.
I know unity was made near the end of the "Ubisoft is evil" time
Lmao. All your souls belong to us
"By accepting you agree to forfit your rights as a human to Ubisoft"
Yeah true
maybe becuase the game is given for free, you accept that you cant ask for a refund or any of the stuff that applys when you buy a game.
I think I know
Oh
A weird thing. I dont think it poped up for me.
That's sketchy af
I guess thats the right for them to take it away?
Huh
And i'm down!
And hahaha that's lucky
wtf kind of legal stuff is this
Well anyway, if you find multiplayer missions in AC I can hop on. never done one yet.
"Close enough"
Yea. I know I only used points cards, I knew the date I sigined up on (within a week), the date I last used it (within 2 weeks), some of the last purcheses I made, and... Thats about all I could give em.
Like that's a hard thing to make up
Even vaguely close would be enough probably
Yeah
Probobly some errors but not enough to look like random guesses
hahaha
Correct enough
I wouldn't have been able to get that
did you actually get that information correct
lmao
they said "Eh its probobyl the right guy"
and NO ONE used the account for 10 years
and I got it righty
considering the info they were asking was over 10 years old
they basicly asked what I had on the account, and what the last 5 purcheses I made, what was new when the account was made, and if I used creddit card or points cards
Yea took like 3 days
holy crap how lmao
Did they manage to do it
but I got it.
ooooof
That... That was hard to get back
Email, username, or password.
and I did not have the following:
I know I had to once try and recover an account
But that's it
Well I had to click a link in my email
I didn't even have to verify anything
I know haha
oh shit that was fast
I made my character very stealth. I can walk up to people and stab them in a croud and no one will notice
that was quick as fuck
hell yeah

From what I saw to make range work you need to pick up a rather pricey skill that refills all your consumibles (including ammo) but once you get it (need to do like 5/33 of the story missions) you are good to go and can just gun people down.
I think i'd go for either stealh or long range
Melee makes good dulist, stealth is well... avoiding fighting, ranged is for picking people off without getting involved, and brute can get shot and stabed and not even notice it.
oooh
Also an interesting take with AC:Unity is there are 4 playstyles and it seems you cant get every skill, so you want to specilize: Melee, stealth, range, or brute.
At least, they have changed so far; if they revert only time will tell but they deffinetly changed their philosophy to Longterm loyalty vs shorterm profit
Yeah Ubisoft definitely seems better nowadays
while Ubi has changed.
Now EA and Activision are doing what Ubi did like 5 years ago.
they were named one of the worst compinies in the world. But they learned and have tried to do good.
I know that Ubisoft has improved their image a lot in the past few years
I could
you could contact their support perhaps for account recovery.
But google authenticator doesn't know anything about uplay
yeah
does that not need a phone or something?
Apparently I connected it to google authenticator
hum
how did it lock you out?
it wants me to use my 2-factor authentication but I don't know how to use it
I saw the unity game has a lot of multiplayer to it
rip
stupid uplay account has locked me out
Lmao

cuz im velma rn
idk if im gonna use it for anything
i drew a little profile picture
Ohh what’s that?

Alright. 2 for 1 and 1 for 3. We looks like you all want overworld anyway
I like 1
So, it looks like <@!136253782131474432> said 2, <@!296572507241054209> said 1 or three, leaning on 1, and <@!331154975457673228> said 3 or 1, leaning on 3. We need a tiebreaker :p
Setting 2 is one of those shows you watch the good guys beat the shit out of everything that moves. Them vs the world.
I guess you could say the feel is more like: setting one is kinda like your weekly show, with each “episode” lasting a few sessions before being neatly wrapped up (sometimes reoccurring villains appears). Setting 3 is more of a long, massive quest that takes place over several movies.
But they won’t give up.
Setting 3 the party knows the final goal. They have no idea if they can ever do it. It feels hopeless to them, as one person said.
Setting 1 very much seemed like “ok, here is a villain, in about 5 sessions we will deal with him. Ah! There is the next one!” They just dealt with problems as they came up.
So far they seem to be loving the story of setting 3.
Understandable. My current group did setting 2, eventually transitioning into setting 1 very late. They ran form level 1-20 and loved it.
I’d vote 3, but I think the whole party would need to be down. If anyone would prefer something more casual and less commitment, then I’d switch to 1
While number 1 has a lot more of Magikeir  and Troldrik.
Also there are funny characters in number 3 too. Tek’osh is an example. “Ohh, Tek’osh like. Would you do for Tek’osh?”
Yea. There are funny moments in it and whatnot, parts to make you laugh, but the overall tone is that of a grimdark. But not 100% of the time, or that would be depressing. The current group I’m running with it find good moments and find jokes in the current moment, while the backdrop is serious and dreadful.
I think maybe small amounts of humour could be a good contrast, and lighten up the dark themes of 3 a bit, but seriousness would have to be maintained for the story to progress
And each npc is a somebody.
I’m running number 3 with my current group. Interestingly, they said that the dead world feels more alive then the livley one. I guess becuase the little things mean more here.
3 and 1
Then humour one second
And I like the ruin one
lol
Top 10 questions science STILL can’t solve!

Robbie eats what Robbie sees
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
....... yummy at all
how is that
shells
he's eating literal egg shels
but
Yea. Robbie always liked his colours.
egg shells
taste colourful
So yea we never had dried painted egg shells to admire :’(
Made them taste colourful
I think he liked the paint
Well they were painted.
just straight egg shells
and... eating egg shells
ohhh nicks grandparents made hard boiled
But Robbie would eat them before they dried
And then painted them all different colours
We drained the eggs out of them
Yes
ate the egg shells?
Robbie
Also <@!331154975457673228> with all the stuff I mentioned before, if you were able to play dnd with everyone, what one of the 3 session themes would you prefer?
So we never got to see the final product 😦
Robbie kept eating the egg shells before the paint dried
But the problem was
We would paint eggs when we were younger
Nice
For the first time ever !!!!
I painted EGGS
Hah
Happy bunny shit say to you too
Hell yes
🐰 🍫 🥚
Happy bunny shitting chocolate eggs day.
Also
What are all of these may Mays I keep seeing?
Also lmao

Obviously that’s what they ment
Ephesians 2:8
For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God
2:8 AM
You could combine fun with a slightly serious campaign!!
But I’m more Than down to do a lighthearted or serious campaign
I just don’t think 1 and 3 can be combined
They all sound awesome though
I vote either 1 or 3 but not both
So the first setting has a lot more people in it :p
But alright, sounds like you like lots of people to fuck with/ have fun with
There are npc in the second world, just a lot less. It’s not flooded with random peasants and what not. Basicly every npc you meet is a one off, somone important.
Definitely want NPCs
I like people
Hmmm
They both do/are.
Not to say the first one is not serious, and the second does not have funny moments.
See how they two can’t be combined?
The other is a lost world that feel apart, there is almost no civilization. You will find people but mostly must fend for yourself in an unexplored land.
One is in a civilized world with lots of people, there are wilds but basicly a lot of the story would be meeting with npcs and dealing with people.
The big thing between the two is this:
I mean yea. And it’s not like if I have serious setting there is 0 fun, and vice versa
Can you combine serious and fun?
Hum... 1 and 3 have hugely different tones. As they stand that is.
Maybe combine 1 and 3 :o?
Overworld!!!!!
2 is mostly is delving underground in a dungeon, returning to the surface to sell ya sweet loot
1 has lots of towns, 3 has destroyed ruins (so not many people.) but there are groups of survivors.
1 and 3 are both overworld
I like overworld over underworld
Hmmmmm
What would your opinion be?
That we would run come summer
About a campaign
What I said above
What's going on?
:o?
And if staky is joining us, her opinion too
We would need <@!331154975457673228> and <@!296572507241054209> opinion
The first is very light hearted and humorous. Most things run on puns.
And there is a lot of Eldrich horror and beasts and what not. The second one has a mixmatch of everything (its “the dungeon” known for lots of stuff)
Imo
Maybe a mix of one and two then
There are funny moments the 3rd, but the tone is very serious compared to the other two.
I love humour in the campaign but 2 and 3 seem really cool
Oh man I kinda want a mix of all three
It’s tone is more serious.
Also to note: the 3rd campaign is a grimdark, so it can be depressing and twisted. Not to say there is no humor,  but it’s a lot less light hearted compared to the other two.
@everyone
Those are the options rn. If none are interesting, I could come up with more :p
3: you all find yourself in the ruins of the “Eternal Empire”. Explore a lost world and figure what just happend, and if any survivors can be saved. Exploration with some rp and combat is this campaign, with lots of mystery and discovery.
2: exploring the mysterious dungeon, finding powerful magic items, and slaying all within for riches and glory. Combat is obviously the focus here, and getting rich. Magikeir and others are here, but exploring the overworld probobly wont be your focus (note, this can be combined in the other campaign if the players wanted both).
1: a world filled with puns and funny characters that you can explore and laugh in, tavern hop, and see your classic friends including Magickeir. This setting focuses more on rp then anything else.
What settings
If I ran a campaign there are 3 settings we could run
Anyway
Stacey would be fine joining
Oh hell yeah! We will probably miss Finn's but if you're still hanging after could have a drink or two
If you’re down
Sawyer and Annie and I are going to finkigans in a few mins
Depends on how late we leave here
I talked to Eric about hanging out but we may just go straight back to Ottawa idk yet
Also were in Portage rn
I'd be down
Would we invite Stacey?
But would like to know who can play it for summer
I’ll fill ya all in later
There is basicly 3 types of campaigns I could run
If we do, I’d want to know what type of campaign you want
Dnd would be great
And if so, who’s in the party?
Also @everyone are we doing a dnd campaign this summer?
Sawyer was asking if we are all going to hang out
We are back too
In renfrew?
Nick and Brianna are you guys back? <@!136253782131474432> <@!296572507241054209>
Yea
Oh fuck that's wild
Wow

She was recording it pretty sure I'm in it
Pretty sure some kinda relationship thing
Like screeching
Couple of people arguing outside Walmart
And uh
Walking back from lunch
So
I wonder if you’d be into an English degree in like fiction focus or something
Ahhhh spurs suck
Happy 4:20
Yea. Not a fun time.
Hhh the thought just makes my feet hurt
Aparently they can do an operation to remove it but it’s only done if Nessesary. Becuase there is a chance to destroy the bone or something.
Yea it is
it sounds terrible
It’s why I legally can’t run.
I’ll have to go to one. I remember when I dmed for you guys at nicks I would stand but by the end of the night my feet were killing me. Also when I was younger I couldn’t run, I never put it all together untill recently.
yeah definitely try clinics i went to one to get pills and shit that i needed and they hardly even needed to contact my family doctor
Yea. Documentation would help. I know I have it based on what he has said (only accurate thing he diagnosed) and people I have worked with when I said what it felt like “a hot iron poker jabbed up your leg” they said “oh yea that’s deffenetly heel spurs.
If he is the only doctor a 20% success rate is better then nothing.
you should try going to a clinic and see if they'd write up the documentation for you
ooh if its anything similar to renfrew tho then yeah that would probably be why
Old hometown
No, not renfrew
Probobly Becuase he is located out in a smaller town and is one of the only doctors
is he from renfrew?
like this is shit that normally gets you like fired for doing it ONCE
He is old as fuck. Should have retired but never did
how is he still practicing
...
I really don’t like that guy.
He has also misdiagnosed my mum too. And thought my dad was not having a heart attack one time
Mum mentioned the conditions to a nurse and she said he needed to be rushed to an emergency imedietly becuase it’s dieabetias
When my brother was rapidly losing wait, wetting the bed, and passing out with huge mood swings at 8: “oh that’s normal he is just transitioning early from puberty”
My brother would be dead becuase of him. Failed to identify he had dieabetties
youve gotta demand written documentation about it thats bullshit that he wont give it to you tf
Man I hate my family doc
So from my end, it looks like I’m just “failing to do my job”
But I don’t have medical documentation going for me becuase my family doctor is an ASS
thats super against workers rights to fire you for that
like thats like a medical condition they're required to like,
so not allowed
thats
...
And gotten let go after 2 weeks for unable to perform
I have done that
See
mention it AFTER you get the job
And I’ll physically pass out and get sick if I stand for more then 6
dont mention that in interviews
but heres what u gotta do
I can’t stand for my then 2 hours without huge pains
HHH that sounds awful
So
Not as long obviously, but I am 24/7 walking on bones that dig into my heels.
That’s basicly what I have
But the bottom of your heel
And imagin that it’s not attached to your shoe
Is actually made of bone
Imagin that the long pointy bit
Ok so
yeye
👠
Have you ever worn stilettos
So like
no what are they 😮
Did I even mention before about heel spurs? I don’t even think I knew I had them when I hung out with you guys before
Yea. The biggest thing that has been hard for me to find work is my heel spurs. I can’t stand for more then 2 hours at a time... which a lot of places they need you to do 8 hours of standing I find.
you might have to cashier and do other things there cuz its like a comic book/boardgame shop but that stuff is still well within the realm of being relevant to u i think
hahaha
Often bore people’s ears off probobly :p
It’s also one of the few things I can actually talk about a lot. I find I can like be silent in convos irl becuase idk what to say, but dnd and stuff I can go on forever
I need to get in touch with them then.
the wizards tower is one of them i think
there are ways to get paid for it, I know of a couple stores that run dungeons and dragons games that you pay for
Before I never really knew what I liked, but after dming for like 3 years now I can say with confidence it’s this
Just gotta find a way to get paid for it and I am golden. Dming is the one thing I doubt I could ever get tired of
Well, I have found my passion after uni. Ain’t nothing I love more then Dming, storytelling, etc.
honestly fuck algonquin college
over my rights to reduced course load
for half an hour
i had to sit there and watch the lady who deals with all that stuff ARGUE with him
That’s also sounding bs
because my course co-ordinator didnt want to change how he had his precious set up
and not just that but I was in the process of being denied my right to having a slightly altered course load
Ah yea. That ain’t fun
the teachers are awful, not in their ability to teach but to BE teachers
the way i was treated combined with everything else was a joke
i should have gone to someone really
Still that blows with your school
Oh well, past now for me.
I just did bad haha
So yea.
The proff for that class said to me before the exam that: unless I got 90% on i was Likely going to fail.
At nipissing I just was doing way worse then I thought and my total grade was too low. Even then, I thought of maybe being psychic major- that was my worse grade. Second bet was sociology: failed that to. Then computer programming was my fallback.
no other school that teaches animation does that
but like thats because they choose to make it do that
and they say its because eventually the classes all meld together
But failing one class means all others also fail ain’t right
i was good at everything else INCLUDING animation which is what i wanted to do but because i wasnt good at layout i failed
I understand if you failed phsyh 1, you can’t take year two of it
its fucking trash!
it is!
That’s bs
you fail the whole thing
the way they run their course over at the good old algonquin college is if you fail one class
but see
one
just
only class i failed
infact i failed that
which every single one i did well in except one which was layout
being in an art course i never had any exams or tests just final projects
i did alright in english
hahahaha
With all my spelling errors
I find it ironic the class I did best in was English. The thing I did worst in high sho
You go from around ab 80% to a sub 40
Well, when one of your classes has only midterm and exam for your grades and you flunk the final.
Well, I thought I would at least get the minimum needed to pass.
theyre supposed to warn you at the very least
I actually got kicked out of uni, not quit. My grades were too low to return haha. I thought I was doing way better then I was.
i did and thats a long winding story of bitterness and anger
I won’t.
not
do
trust me dont
Went to uni for a year and that’s already a lot to pay back. Don’t want to repeate for no reason
And I don’t want to make a massive money and time sink.
Haha. Family is pressuring me to go to collage or uni again but like, idk what I would go for.
they never went so
im kidding tho they never make fun of me for dropping out of college
get the sassy comments about dropping out of college DLC now
**batteries not included*
Get your patented *Family Argue Time* for only 9.99!*
The closest they have been to talking about politics is when trump was elected. It was like “oh wow I get elected. That’s weird”
ours doesnt until we decide its time to have family argue time™
I don’t think my family gives a rats ass about politics.
Lol
we talk shit about douglas ford and my dad tries to convince us to be conservative and its like fuck off thomas
haha its good arguing
Sometimes games
We never argue. Lots of tv and talking.
mostly about politics
when my family gets together we watch reality tv and argue
So... not a great selection.
... oh
But the only games we have to play are monopoly, chess, and clue.
aw thats nice 😮
Sometimes we play board games
I will consider it tomorrow. If family does nothing.
short to the point good clear plot with good characters
but yeah i would recommend this
for arms
or like
he has like, swords under his arms
i really like it so far
Interesting. I prefer English over sub, but if it’s good I’ll watch sub. Seems like an interesting concept
and thats SICK
but yeah the character is blind and deaf
idk how u feel abt subtitled
FUCK and subtitled
so heavy referances to Buddhism
in like that its set in feudal japan
japanese culture heavy
BUT
im not even trying to sell anime rn its just kinda sick
check it out if you want
this is the video that made me decide to watch it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd0WllUfLJA
I’ll look. I have been disappointed by most shows but I’ll see
do ro ro
Dororo.
really interesting kinda creepy
Oh yea?
its called dororo and its got a very GOOD very clear plot
like im watching an anime rn i think you could possibly like sean
like definately i have an appreciation for a well written story and a plot and shit
and smoogie is like literally fuck you smd
being all smoogie u cant be a sheep you fucking cunt
her friends were being DICKS
I see
fucking QUEEN
you bet she is
Is that a cotton candy woman
here for it
badass bitch

Also smoogie is lit and my favorite character of all time
I am very picky with my tastes.
Like sweetness and lightening is literally just about cooking but the whole time its making you identify with what it's like to be young and struggling with adult concepts and issues
Anyway
Yea. But I love to see a story unfold. Trying to peace it together as I watch
Like slice of life animes that I watch generally are meant to build a character
Meant to make you just feel something when you watch it
Like sometimes you get shit that's like
BUT good anime isn't always nessisarily driven by a steadfast heavy handed plot
I'm not so much but I know good anime when I see it
Only FMA was enjoyable thus far.
So uh... I’m picky in my taste.
Anime I would like would be: and anime that is well done, good story, has rules it stays true to, no filler or fan service, magic and mystery, and a satisfying story. Oh! And I don’t like watching stuff that’s not finished.
But I think what matters to you is exicution
It has all of that actually
So basicly
See I have an anime that I will defend to the ends of the Earth and that is sweetness and lightening
So if a show is lacking all of that... I’m not likely to watch it.
Now, those are things that kill shows for me. But, for my taste, I like mystery, discovery, and magic
But it's very softcore
It follows rules like that
You might like fruit basket
Now if she becomes a hammer for no reason, there are no rules. So I hate that.
It is shit
And I can confirm
Random, but if that’s it, and it always follows that rule, then it’s a rule of that world I can understand
That one is based off of a real anime
Let’s say she always becomes a hammer if she sneezes, and stays as one for 1 hour.
Let’s take hammer girl
Like
I’m not a fan. I need a world to have rules that I can follow
Like slice of life anime is my fucking jam
Depending
Oooh shit actually I do like those
So it’s just characters in a world with random events.
That type of shit
Like a girl who turns into a hammer for whatever reason
Like a plot that makes no sense. Aka no real story.
What is that exactly
Non-sensical plot
Filler, fan service, or a non-sensical plot all kill it for me.
I like anime that's like.. either really stupid like EXPIDENTALLY and watch it ironically or like legitimately good anime
If it has fan service I am out.
That’s one big reason I don’t like most anime.
Cheap shit
I hate fan service
Fuck fan service
And it follows its own rules.
And yes. It is entirely plot driven, no filler, no fan service, and great execution of plot.
I know. But they have slowly gone through all different aspects that make up cultures around the world and find that I don’t enjoy them. Hence they have said I am anti-culture.
So I've heard
It doesn't have many of the shitty pitfalls most anime has
THO
I've never had an interest in that one
Eh
Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood.
But what one
There's so much more to Japanese culture than anime dammit
Of everything I have watche, it’s the only one I enjoyed.
Anime is and isn't Japanese culture
There is only one I have ever liked.
I've been periodically learning Japanese for like a year
They have forced me to watch several anime’s.
I'm weeaboo to the max
Anti-culture
They found out I am just
All of it
I do not enjoy exploration, new foods, languages, cultural specific things, etc
You who what now
You excuse me
I am anti-culture.
You pardon me
U what
U dislike all things Japan
I am anti-culture
But they learned now
At first they thought I was the anti-weeb as I disliked all things japan
With how I don’t know much of tv or thenworld or anime and stuff
!!
Tyler and Andrew have figured something out about me
Also
No thanks
With 4 channels
On ur phone
And the tv
Watch the Kardashians
I have my phone
Eww
Oh no
I'm going through my ... 15th hyper fixation on it
With no pc
I am at my family house
I can’t
U should play Skyrim
Man I want to play some fucking games. Anything. Bird out of my mind
Beaucse if it is I think I have heard of it but never played it
Wait is it like spaceship themed
That sounds fun
Oh shit

and oh shit didn't see your messages

The meme, to note, was the person wanted the weapon wielded by the leader of the organization. Their own private weapon.
So yea.
The last person said a meme and nothing else
One person said “let me think on it”
One person said they wanted to gain the ability to do something that is 100% the opposite of what the organization stands for (raising the dead in this case)
One person wants training to learn how to do something that would, at minimum, take 3 weeks
Basicly, they are there for 1 day in game to get the stuff.
Well
Haha are they not thinking much about it?
So I’m waiting for them to beianatorm... not much thus far
Just so next session we don’t spend 3 hours figuring it out
They arrived at a group that needs them to go to a dangorus location and do a job. To help, they are each getting one thing from the oriimization. So the party knows what the organization is capable of, and what most of their members are willing to do; now the task I left them with was brainstorming together what each person wants. Basicly what they think they could get. Could be an item, a favour, training etc. Up to them to figure it out together
Haha what was the task
I gave my dnd group a task to do so I can read what they say but they are all quiet
Internet is too shity to do much eaither
Or play clue with family. I wish there was more board games or something to play here
Or murder and plane crashes on discovery
But watch shity reality tv on history
There is like nothing to do at my parents place
Man
Aparently. I have no idea about it
apparently im the only one who watched it
it was one of my favourite installments of scooby doo
I have no recollection of that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdnaLpaVBUs
but it was fuckin cute
so idk how i know about it
it was from 1988 apparently
Lol not really
it was actually so solid

k does anyone remember a pup named scooby doo

I doubt it'd happen but you never know
in the rare event that he had to reset his ipod how ok with that would he be?
Sweet!
And $20 would be awesome
It wouldn't take long
Could you do it for him? Would it take you long? $20ish?
Its for my housemate Nathan's ipod

Alright.
because i use it for like appointments and stuff
but it works better if its a weekday
im always free mondays but i can change that if i really need to
Yea that’s understandable.
I'll probably start to be free for board games again by next Friday. Exams are going to take up quite a bit of my time until then :(
I may be in between jobs starting April 30th so we can start planning and then
But yea any time for board games would be good, but a day for dnd will will have to plan
Shaggy rogers
Ah ok thanks
I'm shaggy
Who is who again
Wait
I'm done exams by next friday
Hell yeah
But id love to do some fukin dnd
Will be till late Sunday/Monday
As in calabogie
I am home
Also
Dnd would be great
Oh hell yeah that's right
Next week
Tomorrow?
I’ve got a party Friday here, you should be on the fb event
Noice
End of next week we'll have some pints and maybe look into setting up some DnD <@257986741896609802>
Well you're almost there
Two hardest exams next week, and huge project the one after that
:(
Not even close 😦
Are you done with school
Yes lol
Ah that would do it for the stress and dehydration
Drank way too much coffeee today regardless
*
Idk
Maybe from stress or dehydration irk
Randomly achey as shit
Ah damn dude you're not having a good time
And my leg randomly hurts
Have a horrible headache too so it’s for the best
Hahah going to do that now
Have you tried abusing Tylenol
Maybe i stupidly lifted some shit wrong and am just noticing now
No clue seems random
Oh shit dude how come your back hurts
GDI
My back hurts and idk if I can sleep 😦
Ducxxxk
They’re classics
Love Quentin
I'll have to watch it then
Oooh
His first
Quentin Tarantino movie
It got put on Netflix
Is it a movie or a show
Ahhh I just saw it, it’s a goody
For eventually watching
It's on my list though
I haven't
If you’ve seen that
Reminds me of the guy from reservoir dogs
Yep
Part of the train robbery
Fucker
Yeah that fucker
Psycho fucked
Tom or whatever
Phhhh shit
Helper for Walter
Guy Jessie's age
What's his face
Who shot a kid in the face? Lmao
There’s definitely some parallels
Alienating their families
Yep, they were almost the same
But he couldn’t swallow his pride, same as Chuck almost
Grey matter literally offered to pay for Walt’s surgery
Lmao
Always accept help or you'll become a tv villian
Like Don Draper, Walter White, Chuck McGill
Let’s learn from the mistakes of tv show people
What a broken man
He was too stubborn to accept proper help too, because then he would appear weak
Lol
He only got better at the end in order to compete with him lol
True :/
Whenever his brother was unsuccessful.....
A vacation probably would have been good for him
He was doing ok when things were looking up
And self love therapy and what not
With lots of loving animals
Maybe going to like a year long vacation or something idk
Yeah not sure how he coulda gotten out of that one
Like Chuck
At a certain point the mentality sticks
Some people feel that way permanently
Hell most people feel that way sometimes
I can totally see the reasoning
But you can see the reasoning
It’s bad logic, since there isn’t really a unified “world” or “society”
If the world isn’t fair to you, why be fair to the world
That's true. After a while it becomes justified in the person's mind to be evil
Yeah those are special people
Or try to
Some people take a terrible situation or upbringing and use that to propel themselves to being the exact opposite
Some people can take more shit it’s true, but I feel like if you feed anyone enough shit they eventually break
Different people react differently to shitty situations
On the long scale
But nah man it’s true, you’re generally right
Some people are legit genetically psychopaths though, or have brain tumours that make them aggressive and shit
My statement is a little too generalized
I’d say 80% environment, 20% genes
Shitty situations equal shitty people
It's true
(For the most part)
Bad people aren’t born, they are created
There's definitely a breaking point but it's pretty late in the show
Yeah true
Wait no that was someone else
But the whole slowly raising the temperature of the frog water thing, shifting baseline syndrome, makes you keep sympathizing with him until way longer than if you were shown scenes out of context
He shot a kid in the face
Who does that
He became worse than the damn cartel
Like he progressively got worse and worse
Like he actually “broke bad”
Walter was such a shitty dude eventually
Just to put him down
And later when he tells Jessie to his face what he did
Legit having stress dreams and shit
I don't blame you for that
It goes downhill sk quick from there
Like I noticed myself getting more stressed out in my own life
God that scene is horrible
I stated to actually get bummed out
Man I had to stop when Walter killed jesses gf
Haha
I may have to re-watch breaking bad' for the third time after bcs
So hard to stop bingeing
That’s why breaking bad was so fucking addictive too
It's damn art man
Yeah!
Like a long movie
It's really telling a story
Yeah
It really feels like the whole show has been written out already. Unlike some shows where it's made up as they go
It’s not written season by seasons like other tv crap
Vince Gillian writes shows so far in advance too
Like he isn’t even Saul Goodman yet
It’s crazy to think about what they have in store for Saul
But that’s really what it was
When I first got into BCS I never realized it was going to be a story of brothers
Lol
Prolly
Idk
It has to be a nickname
Or is that a nickname
Is his name actually nacho
Hahaha
Lol
Or whatever nacho called the hummer
Hah
Schoolbus for baby pimps
Where’s my baseball cardz
Lmao no
I'm definitely finding s4
You are the guy with the hummer
Damn such a crazily good show
And the apathy is what led to suicide
From anger at it to apathy
I can totally see that
But he tore himself apart
Like how he was really smart and had so much potential
I think the house is a metaphor for chuck
It's so good
Fucking Vince Gilligan and his store writing and cinematography
The whole house ripping apart scene was depressing too. Such a nice house and it's like he just lost control. He knew that it was all in his head but he let himself forget thst
I was emotionally ruined for like a week after that
Yep
He had already checked out
It was unsettling and it got really fucked when you realized what he was doing
Really apathetic jerking, like he really didn’t care how long it took or when it would happen
The jerking was really unsettling
It'd be so painful
What a way to kill yourself too
But yeah he dug himself a hole
Christ I know
The fire part was so depressing
Yeah. He deserved it, but right then I knew it was the end for him
And he did it all to himself
No wife, no career, no family
It felt good to see him get kicked out though
And his life
In the end he lost his whole firm
I hadn't thought of that but yeah
You can’t fail if something is stopping you from trying
It’s an excuse to stay out of life, from the fear of failing if you were in it
Yeah it’s really fucked
Yeah. His whole electricity thing was his interpretation of his anxiety and depression
That’s part of depression man
That he stopped letting love into his life
Which is super sad
Yeah, and chuck never knew that, refused to see that part of him
Idolized him
It's really unfortunate because Jimmy just looked up to chuck
He knew jimmy would outshine him once again
And when jimmy started to be a lawyer too, he couldn’t take it
Yep, and being a good lawyer was the only thing he had left where he was winning
So he tried to hold him down
I guess he was always in competition with Jimmy
And he hated himself
Yeah I remember that. It was brutal
And she didn’t get it at all
Chuck tried to say a joke when they were in bed
And then not at chucks
Yes, but she laughed at jimmies jokes
None of that was Jimmys fault, but easy to see how he would grow to hate him anyways
That's what you got from it too right
From what I understood she left because she wanted to take a job that would mean she was on the road 100% of the time eh? And it would have been easier for them to split
His mom not loving him as much
His wife leaving him (him not being funny enough)
His dad failing
All of chucks bad experiences he tied back to jimmy
Which he associated with being a lawyer
Unsuccessful, in his place, out of “chucks domain” “chucks life”
And thought the only way to fix it was keeping jimmy out of the way
It's just Jimmy's style to be sly
Yeah he wants bad, but he also thinks jimmy wants bad, in his heart he thought that jimmy was the worst
Jimmy means well but ends up doing bad
They're like opposites
Chuck clearly means bad
I feel like Chuck just went way overboard. You can tell Jimmy means well
Going further down the rabbit hole
Chuck just kept making mistakes
True
Like they do a good job at showing that bad people aren’t just born, they are a product of their experiences and mistakes and environment
It could be anyone they cared about
I don't think the names people call out on their death bed really mean much
I get that. It'd be terrible but still
Your moms dying and doesn’t even care that you’re there, just wants her better son
Yeah but like imagine how bad that made chuck feel
How can you be so cold
What a piece of shit move that qas
Didn't call for Jimmy or even tell him what she had said
Oh god yeah that was awful
Like fuck
And asked for jimmy
And when their mother died
Yeah
He wasn't a good business owner
No his father just kept getting scammed
But he never was
He was literally convinced that jimmy was awful as a kid though and the reason their dads shop closed
Yeah exactly
Even with the way be treats him
Couldn’t feel happy if his brother was successful
Jimmy is a sly mofo but he's very caring for him
Troubled
He was so troubles
Nah I feel pity for him
Yeah same
He's just such an asshole
I was emotionally wrecked
Honestly I can't feel bad for chucj
Yeah that scene was pretty brutal too
Lmao

Ah yep same
Fire
Chuck
End of s3
U saw
Wait what happened in the last episode I saw
Oh no way
Just not on Netflix
Oh season 4 is out
I still hate him
You wanted him to die horribly too
I know
Jesjs
The end of better call saul
Haha pretty direct method
But yea. Best tactic for a stealthy assasin is to just sprint at them and kill them before they even relize wtf is going on.
Snippers are OP in this. They oneshot you if they hit you.
Also I was stuck on this mission in AS for like 30 mins. Guy surounded by 7+ men, out in the open, with like 30+ men in the local area on watch, most of them snipers. Kept trying to take out snipers one-by-one or stealth close, but got spotted and died. Finnaly I just sprinted at him, and before anyone realized what was going on I stabbed the fucker. Managed to escape before snipers gunned me down.

Her skin gets covered in these angry red patches of discoloration, and these patches have what look like pus-filled boils on them. It didn't look like a fun time for Daphne, and it definitely did not sound like a fun time for Daphne either."

Even the one Nick gave me for Valentine's day is improving and getting ready to flower again
Well we'll see and hope I guess, he's the first one that I've had recently that's died so fast
Either that or water wasn’t the problem
If it’s not better 12 hours after watering then it’s dead
He's one with soft fluffy leaves
Watered him but he doesn't look much better
I really hope not it was only just today this morning I noticed him like that
Could already be dead though
Most of our plants aren't like big on water guess this guy needs more than most of them
Probably lack of water it seems to me
Ahh must be one we gotta water more then
Probably die unless fixed now
Lack of water
Could be anything
Nooo he's not gonna die is he?

they may hold nothing, but they are mine
and from it I can watch over my vast lands
because it is my throne
Lmao why shon
so when I open the Windoor, it almost crushes me
everything in the corner
I could have spaced it out but no
and there is just a huge empty space around me with nothing
I have my whole setup in the corner of the room
just like my old place
Also
Hahaha
we often open the doors to let some air in, so the whole street can see our apartment.
Is it? I havent a clue. There is just a double door for our window
It's for bringing furniture in right?
THUNDA
hear that thunder baybeeee
saw lightning
here we go
so we just have a double door on our wall
if we were not on the second floor
it could serve as a way out
It just opens to the outside
Lmao I'm jealous of that
double doors actualy
lol we have a door for a window
We can't see anything because we barely have windows
wilddd
thundr is still rolling in
I saw that strike
Thunder
Oh baby
It's blue speed mouse

I never knew I related to Sonic so much
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/014/205/d0b.jpg
thats why he always run
if he slows down he will know
because his guilt has not caught him yet
hes too cocky
sonic knows no such thing as guilt
Sonics shady past
thats why he runs
his guilt will catch up to him
He's a damn dirty gremlin
if he does stop
Sonic never stops
and besides
with an anxiety inducing 10 second count down
thats why he never stops
then die
but if he stops running he'll go underwater
so he never needs to swim
because water cannot run as fast as him water cant catch him
if the fish are under water sonic just has to run at them
sonic is not horrible rat
which they are not always
only if the fish are at the surface
to kill fish
so he does not need to swim
but sonic can run faster then water
he cannot swim
sonic cannot kill fish
disagree
agree
Do u agree
sonic is a horrible little rat. he is a danger to all. he spins around and kills fish and other things. he is very careless. i would think he would have landed on his neck and broken it one of the times from being so hyperactive. dr eggman should call animal control and say “hello some blue rascal hedge is after me and killing things” and they could come and lock him up. gremlin man sonic.
Yep
We probably heard same one
Hahah
thought it was a car crashing outside or something
I just heard that thunderstrike
Crazy thunder storm

Brianna what
Like... 3 weeks ago
Like really recently
I was this 👌close to buying elf ears I didn't need plus liquid latex to apply them
the art in this game was gr8
because you have SO MUCH MONEY
mr crabs characters
Just drop a city and INSTANTLY make it a level 30 city
money money money
Yea, the broken lords. who were borken. lol
Im willing to drop 30 bucks on the prosepect of elves
I was often the broken lords
oh boy this is bringing back nostalgia
A long time ago
I know elves are all about getting more production, to build more things, to make the "World Wonders" faster and more of them
They're like little aliens I love it
When did you guys even play this. I don't remember this game
yes
Are the wild walkers the elves?
lol if you got it I'd love to play a game of it. Game is like civ but I liekd it more
elemental things
they have great nature buddies
I want it
HHHHH
they are base game
nope
Are the elves dlc?
Im only missing 2 dlc
https://endlesslegend.gamepedia.com/Wild_Walkers
Not sure. the base game goes on sale, then there is a lot of DLC
I'm not at home I can't buy it rn
How much is the game
8O
They are all about just being 10% better then everyone else
Brianna is 1000% interested
https://tenor.com/view/fantasy-dragon-pixies-digital-art-pretty-gif-11149126
I somehow don't own endless legends
yes
now briannas interested
They are 100% elfs
You can be elf?!?!?
Elf????
yea the basic bitches
boys
And yea I loved playing the cultist
Then theres basic elf bous
ze tinkers
but they cant declar war themselves. ALSo this group can ban people from using the global market
another group can move their citys if they want. just pick em up and walk around, use them as weapons of war
the cultists
Also
Another group cant get food, which everyone needs. to level up their citys they have to buy it with gold
shon is always the robot things
so I own all of the DLC
Im wating for the last 2 DLC to go on sale
I don't think I've ever seen this game
Its a good fukin game
I thought nick may have played too
of EL
yea its a great game
Shon and I played 81 hours together
another has to live on the ocean
the moment they see you they declar war
one group litteraly cant declar peace
.... a lot of it
like one
each civ is MASSICLY different
rather then everyone is similar, with tiny differences
we played it
Ohhh yeah baby
but
its like civ
it has not 1, but 2! single city things
:o
No I haven't
any of you hear of Endless Legends?
There's no in-between
Also
Same lmao
same
At all
When I play civ I either play it for 12 hours straight or I just don't
Ah that's dumb
nothing like that in civ 6
there are, but venice could basiucly be a city state
No city-states?
I love civ 5 venice
And making my people happy
I just like hoarding special resources
Except russia
Also not a big fan of Civ6 because no single city civ. Like vencie
that should be every nation
That fits my playstyle haha
I do like that Canada can't just randomly declare war

Also although there are jokes about canada, its also true.
Then he would go apeshit mad
SHHHHH
It was originally a glitch haha where his passiveness variable would overflow and get extremely negative or something
Because they're all so tired
Hi disappointed tho that Canada is 90% jokes, I'm dad
I am disappointed tho that Canada is 90% jokes
God bless

You sick fuck
I'm not judgement free
yes i am thank full- full of gummie bears hopes and dreams that is
ur lucky this is a judgement free zone
oh no
sometimes when I eat gummie bears i invision their entire lives up to the point they are eaten, and how quickly their hopes and dreams would be dashed away by sudden death. it brings me great joy.
<@!331154975457673228>
Lmao
I do it out loud. Tyler says he hears me though the walls, and I sound like some kind of satanic cultist invoking a ritual
Voices *
I talk in character as NPC’s that the party has not met in my campaigns, saying what they might say when they meet, and practicing their vices
the lyrics are generally just 'shes my little kitty happy little kitty shes my little kitty and she is so pretty' and thats it
especially when im alone
im alone
even when
all the time
i sing to kenya
i got nunin
I got like fourty messages
Same
for some reason discord thinks these messages from august are new
There's nothing to snipe!
Pls snipe
People admitted to me that people were incredibly mean to me when i was in school and its low-key really cathartic that other people noticed it too >>
Yummy!
Yep
That was probably like , tubey cuz of ur sinuses
I think it's a really long blood clot
Sometimes I give birth to a squid-like appendage made of blood from my nose when I have bad nose bleeds
oh lol
moidled me
murdered haha
moildled ?
i think i channeled a past life as a baby seal
later i was crawling around this ship slowly dying because i was drying out then someone came and moildled me like a baby seal
also hAH
i remember in the dream i looked up and it was just this mountainous net full of mermaids pressed up against eachother dying
I sea
screaming
they werent fat but they were like..... desperate slimy writhing fish
now im imagining really fat ugly mermaids
we were fish coloured and slimy
we werent even pretty mermaids
horrible dream
I had a dream last night where i was a mermaid who got caught in a giant fishing net, and i managed to slip out of the net but was slowly being pulled back under the writhing giant net of other mermaids trapped as they reached for me to help them escape too, but really all they were doing was pulling me back under the net and slowly suffocating me
That is a vert refined type of nightmare and I hate it
I had a dream where there was a woman who lived on a farm and when she was really stressed about an object/thing/person, something would happen where it would change gradually into some dangerous different looking entity, and the more stressed she got about the objects/creatures, the more they changed and the more dangerous they became. Thing is, she was always stressed enough about things to go around creating these awful things all the time, but never stressed enough about them for them to get dangerous enough to kill her. But once the things were there, if other people were stressed/scared of them, they can feed off of that and kill you
<:shrekdab:586271654204932126>

and it spilt everywhere over the sink
probably better than dirnking ranch
so I gaged a little when I tried to chug it
ew
it had diced tomatos in it
it was not pure sauce
the porblem was
the
The sauce
Why would chugging sauce quench your boredom
But why would that ever be better than not chugging sauce
and had nothing better to do
extreamnly exausted
I was hungry
I am so sorry
Shon why would you ever do that
im sorry
Nooo
No
I once chugged a can of pasta sauce out of pure bordem
ah thanks
its a fishnet covering for your genitals
lmao
It's the inner part of a fishing net
lmao
I dont know what an internet is but I keep hearing people talk about it and at this point im too afraid to ask and feel im too deep in it so I just nod my head and agree.
i sometimes buy a ben and jerrys icecream tub and end up eating the whole thing and then go to bed without having had dinner
lmao
I constantly talk to myself pertending to be NPC's the party will encounter, with their voices and everything.
I never ever talk to myself but I have full conversations with my cat
i also use kenya as a pillow
i buy cookie dough ice cream just to eat the cookie dough
Lies

And am a pastafarian
I clean pasta for a living, and only have one customer
An unrelated confession: I make pasta every single day of my life. I can’t get by without spaghetti.
Whenever I make spaghettini ends up everywhere. On me, in my pockets, all over the fridge, it fills up the tub, clogs my pc, and covers my roommate. It takes days to get rid of it all, a complete mess
I guess try now
Framed u
And said u robbed me
I gave u money
You don’t have money to rob
Try robbing me now
Never?
How many successful times have I robbed you guys
Well

Sometimes when I watched people eat painted egg shells I got hungry and wanted to eat them too.
Just a hunch
Yeah! How'd you know?!
Where you looking through a strangers window at a party and saw one of them shit all over the floor?
Weird I had a dream almost exactly like that one
Lmao

I had a dream last night where I was over at a friends house and they just suddenly shit all over the floor.
I had a dream where I accidentally shat all over the floor while having friends over last night.
Lol
i hate inequality but secretly enjoy it when it works out in my favour
When I plan encounters for my party I always think “this could kill them, I shouldn’t do this” but then I take a swig Of Pepsi and say fuck it, they might survive it.
Lmao
Sometimes when I go to bed I forget how to breath and when I remember it’s suddenly daytime

this is why they pay programmers well
this man did this in 9 hours
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0kmDiJ68CA
super fucking cool
this is also how i learned about principle components analysis
yeah
haha thats why there are libraries
Luckily they've made libraries for it very easy to use
Machine learning is wild and out of my skill set completely
That's insabe
recurrent neural network
then playing the midi as music
converting midi files to text files, training it on the text files, then converting them back into midi
Oh damn I'll watch that when I can
to show how he sets it up

educationally
these videos are excellent
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SacogDL_4JU
thats awesome
oh damn
And it's insanely good
ive watched a shit ton of youtube vidoes on this subject randomly
The bot that is on subredditsimgpt uses a library I can use
There's some really cool libraries
copying old messages is called overtraining
and getting them to be gramatical is hard
because if its an AI, then it has to output sentences
i wonder if it will even be english
Hahahaha
I can't wait to start this
maybe itll learn to count
I really want to see what this bot will talk about
also the counting haha
sooooooooo many meme coin things
Lmao
It'll definitely get confused by that fuck
itll learn pls beg
Lmao
also from the meme coin days
I may make it a separate bot
Hahahaha
No need for the bot to become sentient today
like "[] has been added to the playlist
I'll have to block that
Lmao
i bet it will accidentally learn to replicate its own bot messages since that appears repeatedly in this channel
I have a good GPU so training the bot shouldn't be tooooo hard
That's ok
Truee
more with pictures
probably a GB worth
theres so much data
discord keeps logs of every message
Yes we absolutely do
We need a son
New project
Yas
Tn
I'm going to do it
So easy
isnt that like a neural network or some bullshit
There's a lot of tools that do all the hard parts for you
how possible is that
do it
So it'll be our son
yes
oh my god
make it respond based on actual responses
Except trained on our own messages and conversations
do it
Wait I could make a bot that is kind of like cleverbot

Research Questions/Hypotheses:
Several questions can be posed related to reviewing the science within IA.

1. From the literature, what are the prominent types of issues that occur within scientific activities in IA processes? Related to these issues, what indicators or criteria best represent the appropriate use of evidence and practise of robust science in IA? 
2. What operational tools can be developed to allow for an evaluation of scientific activities in IA? How do previous IA’s under CEAA, 2012, or analog assessments from different nations or sectors score in their degrees of scientific adequacy under a retrospective evaluation?```

PUHarticularily PUHertinent
Alliteration?
youre picking up on the alliteration
Maybe just a different word that means the same thing
Particularly pertinent just sounds a bit repetitive
dont want to entertain the comparison to other fields of science or appear to bellittle them though
I think particularly pertinent would sound better as especially pertinent
cut it down a bit
Thanks dude
It's like super formal which is good
Idk tbh
Maybe
Maybe cut back a tiiiiny bir

```
As a student graduating from the Environmental Science program, in the Global Change Option, I have been captivated by large-scale interdisciplinary issues. Further, during my studies I developed an interest in the confluence of science and policy. It has been a goal of mine to contribute to evidence-based policy development and evidence-informed decision-making. This is particularly pertinent in the environmental field where multidisciplinary issues require a disciplined application of science that is inextricably linked to human value systems and vested interests.```

holy fuck
yes I do like him
Carpentur brut is great
I want this to be an actual useful and used bot
And it needs to actually be nice
It needs variety though
then we can have rick roll
Haha
like 100
We need to fill it with songs
awe
it has one carpenter song
this is the real playlist
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Mlh2mst5zX5aBu9iioXkE
!playlist
I think a few
is the songs I uploaded (including brut) in the other one
i see
The server is the one that runs most of the time
Then the playlist linked to the bot on the server
One linked to the bot on my actual computer
there's two playlists
fin uploaded stuff
only my stuff uploaded to it
is like
v 0.91 or whatever
but ok
damn it may have to delve into regex
ah
oh I see
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/138LX5V9bHBJKGPyDql5ck
true
except for carpenter brut
if we find a great album
The playlist that's linked to my local version of the bot is the meme playlist
then we can add a whole bunch of stuff at once
Also lol
I think its a good idea
I'm wondering if maybe albums or playlists would have to be voted on
It *could* be a bit spammy
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/138LX5V9bHBJKGPyDql5ck

3VpvErs3oc2asdfasdfasdf - what is this? You think you can trick me into reading this? Bah, I have outsmarted yee
https://open.spotify.com/track/3VpvErs3oc2asdfasdfasdf
NOTHING HAS CHANGED
oh hell yeah
I've added the song to the channel playlist!
https://open.spotify.com/track/3VpvErs3oc29iuZLqM1GN9
the default view just has it ordered by when stuff is added
here were is a link to it
randomly
never going to give you up will definitely show up
itll be random
if you hit shuffle
otherwise no point to it
Hahahaha
gotta be random
I just dont want 'never gunna give you up' to be first
I see
Just by default it sets the order to last added
So the order isnt' really actually set in any way
Like you can sort the tracks based on different things
also, spotify shuffles it itself kind of
it would take up a lot of resources to do it :/
or will said playlist be permemently shuffled
Do you have to click shuffle every time you open it?
So rather then the list being in order they were added, the bot shuffles the list, clears the library, re-adds everything in its list (now randomized).
But if you click on the playlist and hit play with the shuffle button on it'll shuffle it anyway
Hahaha that is actually something I could do
then re add them
shuffle its memeory
it could remove all of them
if it stores all the songs in a memeory
So I can
My bot can't but the API can
well
Ok then
yes
hmm
can the bot remove songs from the playlist?
I think there is a way to randomize all the songs placement on the bots end
everything added while i'm testing won't be recorded
Also
good idea
I killed it on my server so I can test it while I develop
ok
bot*
Yes right now it is
Haha
is the pot down?
https://open.spotify.com/track/3VpvErs3oc29iuZLqM1GN9
shit
aw
not really
do you use it?
ay it works
yes
a free account?
i have an account*
ih ave can ccaount
But
I know you've added a bunch of songs
uh
Do you have spotify btw
There's a shuffle button
yes it can
and spotify itself cant randomize the order?
I couldn't really add in a different order
addToPlaylist(song id)
it's just like
basically I only have one function for spotify that I can use
oh
tbh I think that's a spotify thing
it should be randomized
hum
It's just whatever order it was put in I think
TODO
https://open.spotify.com/album/2alFG2VsPE8xiozFQz3A0i?si=3yOrlGzMSleUVBhvj4ztHA
or is it just the order the songs were put in
does the palylist randomize itself
Just wondering

then everything after that is free game
to verify that it's /track/
it checks the first seven characters after open.spotify.com
idek my own code lmao
no
wait
The bot checks for **7** characters
main takeaway is
so
this is what handles the IDs that it's given

They talk to each other through a channel
There's two threads, one for the bot and one for Spotify
first half yeah
missing past the ?
but
its the url
wonder why it prints that though lol
im guessing what it spits back is all that matters to find the song, and the si thing is for something else

can the bot add songs not from spotify
can
I can beta tests
I, personaly, think rick roll is fine IF there are a lot of songs
We have something that's somewhat usable rn
Ok, before I do that, i'm going to setup a beta bot
Cuz then what if 75% of people like the song
50% voter base
true
with 4 of us thats easy enough
Hahaha
so 2 people have to agree it was a mistake
lmao
2
I feel
Power comes with responsibility
hum
because we trust each other here
I'll make it just one down arrow
like a reactioin
yes
sweet
oh swet
oh no
and if we have 100 songs, it has a 1% chance to be rolled
or that
I can make it so if two down arrows are added to a song url, it'll delete the song from the playlist or something like that
saying "pls no" after a song has been added to remove it
thats a legit good song
But
lmao yes I can
like never gunna give you up
can you add a voting system where we can vote down a song that someone just added if we think its shit
I hadn't even thought of that
I thought it was complete
yeah, i'm glad you thought of that <@!257986741896609802>
and that be how beta testing works
But rn i'm ignoring it
In the future I can make it go through the playlist and add everything in it
I added a check so it verifies that it's /track/ and not /playlist/
Hahaha

bc spotify and discord are both like go or something
and yeah exactly shon
It'll add any song posted here to a playlist I make
But once it's running
any song somone shares here it will add? how'd you set that up?
I'm just setting it up as a docker container to put on my mac mini so it'll run permanently rn
how can i access it

so wait
It has a built in database that tracks songs it contains already

This is the only source

Still the security guard assault seems pretty fucked up
Which i'm happy about
I can't find anything about it so I think it's fake
I actually don't have a source on that, I remember hearing it. So definitely take it for a grain of salt. Trying to see if I can find a source

Apparently they also steal beats from small artists
In 2018, members of Hippie Sabotage assaulted security guards at a music festival in Oregon.[4]

How was your guys weekend?
Did the hunters get in trouble?
Hahahahaha
We were covered in mud and prob looked like cave hobos
Rude!!
The cops laughed at you?!
>:o
The laughed at us and asked if we had any open booze
Were parked in a field when it was dry and then it rained for 12 hours and we got stuck trying to get out. The hunters were on their way to the road and saw us. Helped push us out and then the cops were waiting at the road
The cops had a noise complaint and were coming to check it out. The hunters were practicing shooting on crown land. They all had permits and everything. Huge fucking guns though
Or they just HAD them
Because they were firing semi automatics
The cops were mad
So
I just slept most of it
I barely even follow
Haha god damn dude eventful weekend
Jesus Christ
Turns out they were ex military practicing shooting
Wh-
Hahahaha
The cops showed up because all the hunters had semi automatic weapons haha
Holy shit
Oh Jesus lmao
I was camping all weekend! Got our car stuck in a field and some hunters came and helped push us out. We were camping during the tornado warning lol

grow light?
It's one of my favourite plants
dang
It's right in the window
I don't want it to die though
= not enough light
yeaaah
winter + basement
a bit stretchy
Had this guy for arou d a year and he's only really just started growing like this
<@331154975457673228> is this normal or is this stretch

I'M GETTING BETTER
luckily it's been a while since i've killed a plant
i mean 90% of plants need a pinky nail to dry out at the top
yep
it's gotta dry out
yeah its a cactus
tried and true
Apparently i've been overwatering it
but it's been in its current pot and hasn't died for a year or so
probably yeah
because it basically has no roots
It should have more roots right
But knowing now what it is
then i second guessed myselff
you guessed it right away tho
I didn't know what you meant by that
Hahaha
ProcrastinadoToday at 4:17 PM
looks like one of those snake boys
or is it an epiphyte
I like that one better lmao
you have the one on the far right
ive got the one on the far left
Wow!
The name alone is reason enough to grow this classic houseplant. Make sure you grow snake plant in the right size pot. Don't put it in a giant pot or confine it in something too small. Actually, that's a good rule of thumb to remember about all houseplants.
Cylindrical Snake Plant
it knew more than I did
The app actually suggested this first lmao
yeah!

oh its a different variant!

see flat leaves

thats what i originally suggested though
that why i was confused
yeah i have one but the leaves are flat
wait it may be a snake plant
the app does like animal tracks and poop and shit
like it can handle a single leaf

get really close
so this surprises me

ive VERY rarely had a plant it didnt know
it doesnt liek havign other shit in the frame
yeah :/
you try other pics?
ah it is NOT guessing it
It's not tooth lancedwood but I want one of those now
its also kinda meant for the outdoors so it biasses towards things that grow here lol
its none of these things
its not a mother of thousands
try to only get the plant in the frame
try a few different pics
its definitely not a pine
alternatively clikc captive species
well
Oh shit right
alternatively
as its not native

do not enable geolocation
then experts can either agree or disagree
the AI will show you what it is
hit Suggestions
you do
do other people label it
idk why they have an entirely different UI
more confusing
its different on android
sure
Do I just say "new observation"?
gotta identify them all!
its like pokemon but for real species
I'll download that!
hasnt turned on yet
my phone is still charging
OH
yes
iNaturalist it
uh
not that I know of
uh
dude
It hasn't grown for a while
yeah
thats a weird case
I'd love to know the name of the plant
buttt
just in case
maybe keep it in the soil
oh I thought you meant bus connection
hahah
"2.5 CACTUS/2.5 CACTUS" lmao
and i am at home
do you not have a tag for it, like that says the species name
where are you rn?
WHERE IS MY CONNNECTION
they cant sit in water
sorta
Epiphyte, also called air plant, any plant that grows upon another plant or object merely for physical support. Epiphytes have no attachment to the ground or other obvious nutrient source and are not parasitic on the supporting plants.
like bamboo
oh shit
epiphyte*
they dont need soil
google that
i think its an eiphyte lmfao
But it's roots are basically non existent
I assumed it would have been ready to be transported after a year
I just know I repotted it and it has so little roots that it can barely stand on its own
I have no idea haha
or is it an epiphyte
looks like one of those snake boys
<@331154975457673228> do you know anything about these plants

https://tenor.com/view/handgun-pistol-put-gun-on-window-sill-put-gun-down-breaking-bad-gif-15190651
Yes I did lol
And I could hear it in my dreams
Nick watched it while I was asleep I think?
it is
Was the breaking bad movie a thing or did I fever dream that
he seems nice
what about that tuco guy
we gotta sell wholesale jesse
do you want another 2 pounds jesse
should do that butane thing and blow up our houses
hah
my scissors were like green
I would have had a bunch of that too
awww man

this isnt from ours but there is scissor hash too
same
i wish weed didnt make me want to yeet myself off a building
I bet it tastes great too
Yeah no kidding
probably fuck you right up lol
like pure THC
holy damn

that's a crazy amount
Fuck, well i've got a list of things to remember for next time
that's insane
yeah he kept it on then rubbed 5G off afterwards
Noooooooooo
My hands kept getting insanely sticky
I had to wash my hands constantly
I would have had so much
apparently its very very potent hash
I fucking washed it all off
he collected it
fuck
and the sticky shit getting on my dads hands
you can save that?
from just putting the weed into jars
wait
We got 5g of finger hash
Yeah if you didn't watch breaking bad I feel like the movie would make no sense
Just hanging out with a bunch of money
I had to rewatch the last three episodes of breaking bad first
Haha badger and skinny Pete were cool
Todd's actor was fat lol
oh boiyz no spoilers
Yeahhhh
Jessie got treated so shitty
You watch it yet too?
Yeah!
El Camino was good
So much Windex
So much soap scum
Awful
It was
wow nice
That was my big chore of the week
😂😂 I just deep cleaned our shower yesterday
Just showered and am heating up leftovers, and that is more chores than i have brought myself to do in the past week
And summer
But I need windows
I know I want to grow one so muhc
thats awesome

yeah
I knew it
So it's possible
https://www.leafly.ca/news/lifestyle/bonsai-cannabis-plant-growing
I guess you can keep them in a permanent vegetation state?
Hahaha
they are annuals so not sure whats going on there
thats ridicuous
<@!331154975457673228> you said it wasn't possible to have a cannabis bonzai plant
https://i.redd.it/82bsjtjmq8r31.jpg
I don't lol
do you know your strain
Idk tbh
whats ideal for your strain
wow
jesus some strains are best with 6 months of curing
There was so much to go through
yeah
I did it purely out of laziness lol
can do two stages of trimming
yeah i read that too
Slows down the drying but keeps the taste and potency a bit more
i guess some
Apparently it's good to leave them on
SOmetimes I got a little lazy
I cut about 99% of my leaves off
we cut them off
yours look way less leafy

Haha jesus yeah those are way bigger


I probably should have
Also I never checked to see if the trichomes or whatever were actually fully developed
Yeah yours looked huge
hahah
those buds there are ones that brianna AGGRESSIVELY tore off
we have less buds on ours than yours, but they are way larger
haha nice
and not a single seed
Now they're just houseplants
we had a couple, not many
I gave up on those plants so much
you notice any seeds in your buds?
lmao yeah
when the light is less than 12 hours
looool yes they will flower with light triggers

It was hard to get to a file size I could post
lol nice
I out my shitty closet weed in the window and it started flowering lol

great!
No stretching
Seems to be getting enough light so far

The one is still stuck in its shell
1.5/3 growing lol

its starting to build up a bit
S3 E3
Ep 3 was really good
was guud
I finished stranger things
ok stranger things is getting better
Yeah lmao
also the old lady with rats in her basement trope lol
yep
Fuck off with the relationship drama
I hate the forced relationships
I did feel the same way at first
everything feels so forced
its so slapstick
It wasn't as good but far from terrible imp
I didn't think it was terrible
Haha
its literally like spongebob music in the background of every scene
wtf is with the soundtrack
Why is stranger things 3 so terrible
Ah damn
hiding*
it was kiding
Id slap anyone with a male
we left a male in last year
Ahhh fuck
and the pollen is in the wind
if any neighbours have any males
yours could be pollinated right now
like right now
pollination happens right away
How did it happen anyway
Ahh
nah they seeded early
Then they seeded
thats why they were like 12 feet tall
Hahaha
We kept the plants going unti llike Oct 14 last year lol

I guess it does frost in September sometimes
sometimes
It should be ok for September eh?
Sure
like just keep an eye on the weather
Ok
lol
I don't want to ruin a pound of weed
youll definitely need to tarp though
I trust him more lol
Ok cool so Axel may be back
last year we kept the plants going until like Oct
Damn
in which case you need to set up a tarp over top of them
How long does it take to bud?
they might not be ready before the first frost
the frost
oh also
unless it doesnt rain for ages
shouldnt be
Is it going to be a problem that I'm not in Renfrew often
now you have to google proper pruning
What should I know? My brothers leaving for NB today so I need to handle it
My plants have started budding
<@331154975457673228>

There's nothing to snipe!
Pls snipe
lol
That's really it though mans a fuckin wizard
Tells you the same story over and over because he forgot he told it to you already
The man's short term memory is completely gone
As good at weed as Pat is he's also an excellent example of using weed in SLIGHT moderation
Haven't gone up there in YEEEEARS
I can hardly remember
Belleville type area
theres a guy who does hydrponic weed there
4 hours away
Pat lives like
Noo no
whats that called again
from timmies to the highway
where tim hortons road is
that hill
Uh
no
not
or whatever
does pat work on that road on thompson hill
My dad is learning from him
its all in a water/nutrient solution
I'd like a space bucket
its where you dont even have any soil
Master man
Pat is like
I think so
Yyyyyyes
thats even more controlled/challenging
hydrponics?
For science sims
They had them in sims 2
Those plant thingys
But I thought he kept them in like
To be fair I got like a second hand description from my dad
https://www.growweedeasy.com/marijuana-space-buckets
Mmmmaybe :o
they have a fan and lights
space buckets

He's w i l d tho
And has them like auto watered
Shelves sort of but not really
And they're kinda like
Those things that have the lights in them
It's like
Gets the growing things
My dad's friend Pat has done it indoors and outdoors for years
or live in California in a house thats mostly windows
My dad is trying to dedicate a room in the basement rn for it
Diligent
like full space closet if youve heard of that
Word
What's the work
But you gotta be pretty uuuuhhh
you can, but you need to do it right
I got a million seeds so no harm
Oh, my dad said you can get them to handle being indoor fully
Just learning
Basically I want to get further than I have before
I'm just gunna see how the plants do
Yeah
late spring - early fall
Haha
more like 5 months
not even 1 year
as in, annuals
I'LL FUCKING DO IT
they only last one year
I'll do it
like
they are not plants that can bonzai
I got one of those

since itll be winter and a basement lol
you may need to use the heater + humidifier combo
I've seen it done
theyre annuals though
I also have another lamp I can throw in as well
lol
I want to try a bonzai weed plant
And I have a fan to use
Well it's really humid in that room already
SHit
Hahaha
maybe less than 5% tbh
and a humidifier
and have a fan in there
unless you invest big and line the whole room with tinfoil and buy some new big boy lamps
I give it a 5% chance of working
Just trying to see what happens tbh
true
Without investing a lot into a full grow room
Doubt you’d get enough light
And full indoors is challenging
Very late to be starting though
Hmm looks good
<@331154975457673228> thoughts on new setup? Will the tinfoil cause light burn?

Hahaha
"Im in murders and executions"
"Im in mergers and acquisitions"
Oh yeah I got a green thumb
nice

Time for a repot
Wow nice!
It worked man thanks

Haha
Ok
pull
just pupll
no
Should I cut them?
lol
root*
i think try to pull
Pls fin
Is there anyway to remove this plant from its pot without cutting all its veins and killing it
<@331154975457673228>

Dammmmmm



ohhhh geez
Its blows in really hard sometimes. The plant was almost horizontal at one point
but wind is good to make it stronger
if you think all else is lost
my dad says has fan on high on it, or put a stake in the ground with a loose twist tie
yeah 😦
That would be sad <:sadshrek:591001826116239360>
Its been getting blow by the wind a bunch too so hopefully it won't snap
you may notice a delay in growth, but its because its putting out more roots
I'll just directly move it into a big flower pot
so when do you, go big
Id limit it to one or 2 pot switches to not stress it out
Gonna move to a balcony
Sweet
I've just had 2 led grow lights ~4 inches above it and the window
or move onto balcony
do you plan on keeping it indoor permanently?
yeah with minal stretching too, so light has been good
Ooh damn nice big leaves
now
hmmmmm
When's good to move to a bigger pot
:O

ah damn
The spot I setup at the dnd was pretty good but it blew the fuse haha
I need to find a darker spot for it
I have to figure out a new setup for my grow
Ah nice
some montreal company shipped them
How did you get your initial seeds
True hahaha
but hey it got us like 10k seedss
Lmao
it snuck in last year
yeahhh
Because of that one male ruining everything?
Even if we only have 4 females (we only have 4 confirmed right now), we would get far far more than we did last year if we can get 10 foot tall plants again
Hahaha
That'd be awesome
sometimes they legit dont have gonads
going forward i should be able to tell you whether they are male, female, immature, or smooth between the legs
Hahaha
and yeah haha those male flowers are long past incineration worthy point
Those are tutorial worthy shots
we took so many shots




My plants keep ending up with this



Haha
ive got a trained eye for it now
before they get anywhere close to that stage
but yeah hahah thats what we are doing at this point
Yeah! But its really hard to distinguish undetermined from male
I never manage until they grow a bunch of pollen sacks lol
Cool! It sounds like it should be fairly easy to gender the plants
the things on the outside are the stipules, which you arent interested in, and the things on the inside are new leaves / shoots
but its always the MIDDLE thing in the nook
Better keep an eye on it
True
but its possible the hairs just havent come out yet
its likely a male since it doesnt have that almond shape, and no hairs
its either a male, or an immature female
Ahhh
So here is one that is 'undetermined'
Is that one a male

True
but this would be visible to a naked eye, and a little magnifying glass for sure
yeah a cheap one
Oh no way
taken with a handheld microscope actually!
And oh yeah!
Nice camera
middle thing in the nook again
I love these macro shots
that looks like moth antenae sorta
Here is one that is female with large new female hairs

hairs are usually spindly, and orange if old but white if new
Cool!
and if its a tight almond shape with hairs coming out, its a female
Haha a gonad
Ooh
the central part of the three things in the nook is a gonad
Oh nice! Is it because of those long hair things
So this is a female
My two outdoor plants at home are huge and same with my dads

While indoor is nearly impossible
I've learned that outside plants basically grow themselves
Haha
1 is kinda stretched but doing okay, and one is really small
So all of ours are outside now
that really sucks
Oh damn lol
Sure!
They both ended up being male and they were terribly stretched
Ill send you our pics in a sec
Damn
Oh how?
It would have however
Both of mine
Haha
I killed the plant actually
Looks like the repot went well
And what are the results?
Thanks!
and whoa! Cool pic dude
My dad and I were able to sex the 12 plants we have going today
This was probably long past due for a transplant


Science is crazy
Lmao that's true actually
Funny how it just converts your soil into THC
The roots didn’t go very deep
You'd need an actual saw to cut those down
I didn't even know the stems could get that big
Yep lol
Holy fuck those are trees

The boys from last year
ahhhh yeah
But I think the top roots were too destroyed
Sad though as he was doing really well
hahaha i thought so
It was beyond dead
Was just throwing it out
Haha no I was just kidding
its sorta possible that it has enough root mass to put out a new leaf but highly unlikely
were you actually being serious about the thing that looked like a stick
otherwise it cant photosynthesize
its needs some leaves lol
:I
:I
It was so dead haha
:I

What D:
not like that'
:I
Apparently trimming the leaves encourages growth
what
what
what
what
But idk
So I did
The internet said trimming it might help
youre joking
No it's my weed plant
lol is that a stick
<@331154975457673228> help my plant has grown with no leaves

the bushes got blood
for the blood god
its natural selection
we need their blood
57 were harvested in the bushses
They had to be harvested
well some of them
Fin no
to roam with the chickens
and yes i felt like freeing them
nicks house
U were moving the cows?
What oh no
Hahaha
I have 57 raw beef on me
57 cows died in the great migration
Accidentally bread to many chickens
This is how Gus got started
Los Polos
perhaps
We should start a chicken resturant
Dear god

2019-2019
rip sever
i think i broke the server
cheat free chickens
i have been using seeds
no access
Nick thinks for a moment- Sure, admin fin cuz he is my firend, but... then he could spawn in infinate chickens... *sweats as he looks at the server stress*
I disabled spawn protection and did a quick reload
I may have to do a full reboot
Are you able to get in now?
now the chickens cant leave your house
... maybe
did you revoke my admin access
i tried to come back from the nether and it spawned me way out behind briannas house
Lmao Findlay oh my gos
they are everywhere
They are in hell now too

CANT KEEP UP IS THE SERVER OVERLOADED?
The server goes to shit everyone lmao
Nick can see in real time what chaos findlay is causing

"Precious"
WHAT HAVE YOU DONR
FINDLAY NO


Lmao
chicken machine gun
Server was set to max 10 chunks
if i stand in the chicken pen I can get eggs as fast as I throw them
Also I increased allowed render distance
Lmao
im making more
It's causing a lot of lag
The server is running 7s behind because of the animals lol
Lmao
the cows are dying from overcrowding
Disabled it
But I found a spawn protection. Setting
Deadmined
saw that lol
Lol I made you admin
works now
Shut up bot
Lemme test skmething
It's been one second
One sec
you should join and try
Gdi
still doesnt work
living inside the server
a full on corporation
thats like
1000 players
lol
And yeah for real
I accidentally stopped the server lol
so much memory
all those players
for 1TB of space
itd have to be i guess
Running the server
It's probably a full company at this point
That's insane
1TB
Jesus Christ
3564 player limit
Holy fuck 1889 players online
nice
Server is restarted

its currently updating I think
Holy fuck lol
Yes
2builders2tools is a minecraft server that promises its players vanilla survival gameplay with PvP, a neverending world and no rules. The IP is 2b2t.org. It has been on the same world since december 2010. 

The world is 962 GB with 77,094 players saved, and 58 months old.
Is it down
Yeah give it one sec
until its done
should i not botehr working on my farm rn
ok nice
It'll be fine
Nvm I'm making a backup before I Jill it
ive been busy
DO IT JILL!
ive done a lot
Force. Jill.
nic
ive
why
NOOOo
I hope the server has saved recently as I need to force Jill the server
Jesus lmfao

still not
nvm
i relogged and its fine
That's really weird
it must have been set to protected somehow
But it was fine before
Wtf
On multiplayer servers, a 33x/33z slice of the world centered at SpawnX, SpawnZ can, at the server owner's or operator's option, be set as "protected", and can then (almost; see below) only be modified by Operators; that is, the 33x/33z protection square's edges are at SpawnX +16/-16, SpawnZ +16/-16.
its a spawn thing
Non-operator players cannot place or destroy blocks in the protected area, nor can they use doors or Redstone devices other than Pressure Plates.
174.115.195.50
ok
Cus I'm too lazy to get up
I need the IP
Well
I'm rebooting
id reboot nick
maybe spawn is effecting it?
maybe its like around someones bed?
its just in your house though
cant place blocks in your house either actually
but not use your bed or tables
place blocks
break blocks
breed chickens
i can still interact with otehr blocks
hm
Nope :/
I know im still online but I cant use your bed and stuff
is your hosue like prtected or something nick?
Hahaha
A face only a mother can love
This is my good plant

Shes not pretty
Yeah...
lol some stretching still
Going to plant her in Renfrew
She got too big
My one girl graduated to living on-top of the stove with the fan light replaced with a grow light
IS THIS HELPING
Lmao
Brianna has secretly been feeding them alcohol
I'm not giving up on either of them yet
That’s manageable stretching though
Yeah
one of the left has bad stretching
Let’s just cross our fingers they stay good
They are looking good rn
That’s good
On an 18/6 light schedule

Lol probably just water and light constraints
For my plants dying
I want a good reason
Good but
I mean
Fuck
That stuff is good
Ohhhh I have that
My dad's actually got a little grow op going on in my bedroom rn haha
It's fairly expensive home depot soil

Can’t use Walmart soil
I think it's my soil dude
Lmao
Put them in good soil my brother made
We aren’t even doing anything for them and they might do better than ur boys inside
Trying to get something like that happening
I planted a few randomly at home in Renfrew
Hahaha that's hilarious
Just from seeds falling when we were collecting them
:O
That we didn’t even plant
There are 17 weed seed boys growing on their own out in my garden
I forgot to mention
Seedlinhs*
Hard to get the watering right that way
It’s lucky they did so well as saplings in such large pots
First time not killing ot
I managed to do the one on the lett in that picture though
Also I'm bad at replanting
Yeah
But the stress might kill it rn
I could replant it
In larger pots you don’t have to water as often
I guess hold the drill upside down
Yeah definitely true
Yeah but hard to turn the thing upside down
Haha I wonder if a drill would work better

Nearly cut myself though
I have the same one, I stabbed a hole in the bottom
It was a cheap thing from Walmart haha
I’ve seen those
Right
But bottom portion isn’t exposed
But the area has no exit to the outside air
It's got small holes into the bottom portion
But you mean it kinda had like a little area in the bottom, but no holes?
The best way is a pot with holes in the bottom sitting on like a plate
Should I put a straw to the bottom?
Shit
Ahhh
Reservoir doesn’t evaporate either
I've always had an issue with water never coming out though
Could lead to drowning
Dangerous
Ohh you can’t see when water comes out
Built into the bottom
Just a reservoir
I should probably stop using this pot because it doesn't really have a bottom that you can see
Then wait until it drys out
It’s good to water but in large flood, like until it comes out the bottom
The grow light dries it
It does get dry quickly though
Hmm maybe not then
Ahhh
I water nearly daily
You may have overcompensated with the dryness after underwatering
Gdi
Hahaha
Brown tips of leaves
It’s hilarious but it may actually be underwatering
But they would probably know with this
Ahh
Once and they told me to soak the plant and I ended up killing it right away lol
You ever try reddit?
Hmmm
But it's growth had stunted
Oh I don't think it's dead at all
I’m not sure, it doesn’t look that dead though
Thinking about it it started around that time
Do you think it could be the root stuff in the water?
Yeah probably not sunburning because it’s the bottom leaves curling

Maybe a vitamin deficiency or something then
Really nearly impossible with LED growligjts
Ohhh really?
It's getting sunburned I think
Looks good
<@331154975457673228> help

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41wpBoQexXL.jpg
I honestly feel like this guy
mushy

I have fucking marshmellow arms

just a chonky lovely boy
he is not a pirate!!!!!
sweetpea is literally my favorite no
yes

reminds me of sweetpea from adventure time
hahahah
look at the size of my hands

amazing
mazing

kk
let me get my equip in tutorial
during a phat dance or something
sure
can you try to find the phattest camera angle for me
compared to before
my arms are fucking enormus
haha
it obsucres like 25% of my screen
every time I see my hand grab something
*ship sinks from weight*
also
i find the idea of an entire crew of 4 phat boys really amusing
I am happy thus far
so this is a gr8 success

deffenetly
youre definitely at least 50% phatter than before
good luck
yes
ill find a small eyed toothless skinny legend next week
haha yea
he also seemed toothless
deformites are hard to come by
thats what made him great
but his eyes were tooo small
face was nice
I did not like his eyes too much
he wont be forgotten
im a bit sad barrel boy is lost forever
i like him in that pose better
im warming up to him a bit

his jawline is too thick for his own good

*shudders*
*fear*
IT HAS SPOKEN
😦
The dice rolled 1 3 times in a row
1!
2 is wholesome, 3 is adored, 4 is devious but great
And the dice gods say...
by* #1
but #1
i feel threatened
1 scares me
1*
in a bad way
scares me though
LET FATE CHOSE FOR ME
and select
hahah
a 1d4
im gunna roll a die
do
I think I know what im going to die
hum alright
but i like ugly so my opinion is bad
i am between 3 and 4
Alright thats a vote for 2
i like 2's face the best
its the face I want votes on
they are all the same phat
Remeber the pose means nothing
its biased
yeah he is fattest in that pose... but
i like seeing side view in other shots of the other ones too
i think i like 2
also <@!296572507241054209> whats your opinion
this is hard
What do you think
the canonball

the beloved
4
the baker

3
Rotund

2

1
here are my choices
Alright
There!
dang
I keep rolling phat black ones
haha okay
then ill make up my mind
Im rolling until I get a 4th phat white guy
are you looking for a face similar to yours now or a tiny head
look at that unrealistic body standard
that thigh gap
Found another supper skinny
unless you want to be handsome and fat
to accentuate the fat
choose the smallest face
its skin colour and face that change
The big boys all have the same body
do you feel as fat as this

and idk if face is just 1 face each, or if its eyes + nouse + mouth
I think its just Body + Skin colour + face
Im not sure if arms and legs are rolled
like one skinny boy had bigger forearms clearly
and skin colour
like calf size is semi independant from forearm size etc
i think they blend features though
but then they can also have difference face types
basicly there are probobly 10-20 different male body types (and I bet just as many female)
that are like
there are different body types
So what ive noticed is is that
makes it look like he has too much fat once his face to see
i kinda love how squished gunpowder boys face is
hahahah

we have a new contended
but I think rights eyes are soules and black
Left does not have his eyes open

its between these two
Im riolling because
did you lock gunpowder boy and you are rolling more?
emancipated
so skinny
look how skinny he is
stitcher jim?
skinny pete
ahhah
Skinny peat

I found him
Fin
so that guy can probably be 'hit' when you shoot next to him lmao
thats good
also apparnely hitbox is normalised
look at the legs
i think skinner than the pic i sent
thats skinny af lol
oh nice
You can reroll a lot and lock ones you like
i wish i had that one
gunpowder barrel is lucky
hahah oh my god
the one with black hair looks identical to your old one
supper skinny

Also I found this
hahah
He looks full phat
Yea me too
i honestly think gunpowder boy migth be maximum chonk
that I rolled
These are the phat boys


i think gunpowder barrel boy is fattest so far





also note you can change hair colour later
wait you can select options???

Here are my options
how do I take a video to upload to discord
Im about to select somone for my base
he is an alien
holy fuck

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gL4Vf2FLtq8

launching game to make phat
Alright
unit
Absulote unite
santa

Compare him to the guy I want
https://i.redd.it/rebs0j1f2yo01.png
This might be the skiniest
Biggy small gang
Biggy and smalls
Yes
haha you dont have to if you fine
ill try to find skinniest lad
im in awe of the size of this lad
when im free next
Just look at the size of him
ill wipe too shon
Just
but also phat
Lmfao
im gunna do it
its litteraly just downsides
also bad for stealth
jesus christ
and youre also a huge hitbox
since its hard to get the phatness to appear in the loop of pirates
Imagine holding that weight
His legs must be very strong
its actually seen as a form of status among the pirate community
with such tinny little legs
OH NO
absulote unite
He's a unit
Look at how massive that lad is
Holy fuck
Pull that phat trigger
This is the biggest boy https://i.redd.it/ly37ro1hr0n01.png
Ok do it shon
you can be like square
Like no neck phat
definitely
yes
I could be like, 50% phater
You do have a solid phat already
The tutorial alone gives me enoguh dubloons to buy any basic outfit again
its just a question of if I do it or not
thats true....
If I want to become phull phat, I better do it sooner then later
not sure about that
even a pet?
It's like deleting your account
Like I can do the tutorial again to get 200 dubloons
what!
I think its a full whipe
I can repeate all the 1 times stuff
like if youve bought your clothes and stuff
BUT
I think you do
I will lose everything Ive goten thus far
do you?
i dont think you lose everything 😮
Yea thats the thing
Although it's better to do it now than later
Lmao is it worth losing everything
or stay the same
phull phat?
What do you say nicK?
or capes 😦
I dont think there are any bright pruple outfits
but PHATTER
you COULD still channel him
hmmmm
go full phat
or
with the body shape of him
do I stay my current character
So the question is
i can only imagine the possiblities
but I could be ***Phater***
My current character has the same body as him
True haha
its literally u
this is you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSfYrPdTKVA
Lmao oh no shon

The glow from Cursed Cannonballs no longer lingers around the player when they stow the cannonball.

Gender inequality has been and continues to be a large challenge faced by society. In addition to being an issue of social injustice, Geena Davis, the actor who played Thelma in Thelma & Lousie, argues that there are a number of other consequences. For example, she postulates that the lack of merit-based recruitment and added perspectives could also contribute to a number of other pressing world issues, from environmental issues to hunger and war (*). One example of a manifestation of this inequality is in gender disparity in entertainment media. This particular form of gender inequality comes with its own range of consequences. ***
It is a responsibility of governments to...
As a result, gender disparity in entertainment media would be a good example of an issue that could be addressed by governments through the development of public policy.
Through analysing the Freakonomics podcast “Does Hollywood Still Have a Princess Problem? (Ep. 394)” (Dubner, 2019) with a public policy perspective, this topic can be used as a case study to discuss key concepts in policy analysis.

This is god
Yes
From the 17th - 20th
We will have a few days then!
And I get back around the 1st

<@!331154975457673228>
the way the ayy lmao drew the symbols: it started with the central spiral, then each spiral that is connected to that was drawn at the same time, then each spiral comming off of those apeared at the same time, and so forth.
Also its important to note
The order those symbles apear in:
The ayy lmao was emiting a very high pitch noise, almost outside human hearing.
The first spiral apeared only after the party played a note on a on a violin that was several octives lower.
The secound symbol apeared when they tried to sing a single high pitch note.
They then tried to draw the second symbol, to which it replyed with the 3rd left symbol.
They reversed a symbol, and it replyed with the 3rd right symbol.
Finnaly, after much talking, the last symbol apeared; and the party felt it was *important*
I-
and you did have one translation though?
But
Once you know one translation of it, and know the pattern, you can solve the rest
But how did you get any actual translations from it
and the curve goes clockwise
other than the one spot where it branches twice from the same place, and branches on the inside of the curve
There is a clear pattern and rules to the language
Now it doesnt say no Brianna's
hah
I changed the name btw
>:)))
#banned
your not allowed in this chat
And his little antenna
BRIANNA
did you have some kind of key though?
and the spiral moves counter clockwise and branches into many levels
Like u got his face
To me it just looks like a little alian
branches ONLY occur in those three places
...
they are just smaller versions of the larger one
it shows three spirals coming off of one spiral
you had a key right?
Look at the bottom symbol
NIck Nick
Nick
how the fuck did you get anything from that?
That is a language of an alien entity
ive solved it
its a non linear language

and how did you decrypt it
what was the image of the code?
you got it
yes
<@!257986741896609802>
middle one says "we dont even have ear wholes, why are your mouth holes flapping"
top symbol says "we no speak americano"
-maybe-
Loooooooooooooo
"The word racist only applies to white people"
oof office guy is off on another issue
The issues caused were minor at best!!!!!!!
It was more muscle hurting juice
As they had OTHER problems but it didn't involve bone hurting juice !
Good thing corsets werent generally bone hurting juice!
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/243/634/963.jpg
Explaining why they're somewhat inaccurate and not including all the facts
Because the video I linked talks about those studies
Bone deformities in general or like ... From corsets?
Yeah the above is a research article on bone deformities
Nice easy
I mean pictures were black and white anyway but they just coloured them in
They literally took photos in black and white and coloured in their waists to appear smaller
By the women
+ alot of the photographs u might see where women have extremely tiny waists have actually been altered
;)

*the gang acedentily creates the matrix*
otherwise it becomes the matrix
right its going to have to stop somewhere haha
Somtimes fights happen on oppen feidls, sometimes it happens in crammed halways. In either case, the calculator cant figure out every possible situation; it might be able to generilize a few, as an advanced option, but a big part of combat is tactics of using the envorment to your advantage.
Consider if there was NO pass, the spartens may have never lost.
the spartens would have died much faster.
consider if Battle of Thermopylae took place litteraly anywhere else
it can generalise though
An example:
and the calculator has no way of calculating envorment
because stratagey also involves the envorment
Also im fairly sure the calculator can never account for true tactctics
because somone has to land the finishing blow
there cant be a situation with everyone dying
remaining enemies
well
if the party loses, there are some left
if the party wins, there are 0 left
ah
starting is how many ennemies STARTED combat with the party
by starting enemies do you mean remaining enemies

everyone always said I was aurtistic
i am a great aertist
this should help greatly
a conceptualisation

this will help you 100%
Here nick
Haha sounds good man
so I can figure out the math
probably do a version in excel lmao
ill get you a black box
the ideas, the backend, and the front end
and shon can advise on rules
okay
I'll build it
You figure out the black box
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box
Basically
Along with input/output
Shon can heavy lift the logistics
yeah I can totally do that
I just need help with the interface
I can heavy lift the math
basically i can just make it haha
I don't know enough about D&D to do a lot of the heavy lifting unfortunately
repeating effects
like incorporated spells slots, healing, lingering effects
to work out in the math
thats really end game stuff
but theres reallly complicated spells
I mean yeah manual data entry would work
could write spell list in JSON that way shon could help transcribe the spells
it gets harder when you incoporate shit that carries over into other rounds and stuff
yeah basic ones
Could just start out with a hand written list of spells
OK, that can be done
to begin at least
instead it should be based off of average dmg per turn
I think the spell list should only be considered once everything else works
thats end-game stuff
scraping would be hard
Scraping
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:eldritch-blast
That's a whole other project
nthen
JS is better than
Yes but
jeez do you think its possible to pull spells stats from wikidot
It can but JavaScript might be better so that it can have a web interface
i think this can be done with python
https://github.com/NickBrisebois/D-DBalancer
I'll make a github
give me a min
i can
when i get home from school
ill do that
I think nick still needs an image
<@!136253782131474432>
Nick we will start a github or whatever
unless its a guaranteed hit on them
swole ass owls
and 8 owls could beat the party prolly
The party could beat 1000000 owls if they got lucky
So the goal is to make a calculator that finds ON AVERAGE what the most balanced encounter is
itd be ridiculous odds but the party could beat 100 owls if the owls somehow roll and miss every time
the most likely outcome
on AVERAGE
59 party wins with 1 person surviving with 1 hp
60 owls win thie 4 owls alive.
but barely
so the party WINS at anything less
so 60 is the perfect amount where its an intense battle
and the answer was 60
its all things
party JUST wins
Its a crab problem but instaed of just crabs
or vice versa
The key thing is, we know that like, 198 owls or more isntantly kill the party.
and 8 owls are killed instantly by the party.
So we wanted to know what was the tipping point for owls to JUST win
Is this still trying to figure out the crab probablem lmao 🦀🦀
and creating the UI
hard programming parts are getting data from the website
chance to hit / crit
AC
of like health pool
of the inputs
(So this is stiill verbal and written) but ill draw you a diagram
but this concept can be extended to monsters with higher AC, where the party deals a certain amount of damage to them per turn (on average)
then make a permutation over each turn
and then you need to know how many owls the party kills per turn
which is calculated by damage and chance to hit and crit
so you need damager per turn per owl (0.4 in this case)
I was walking to my mailbox so I missed a lot
The key for it was
how many owls would kill the party
Its the most simple form of this problem
did you catch the owl discussion
I can draw it up for you
Ok I work best visually
MILLION dollar idea
Hahaha
Ok sure
this works too
This one
Wait

"turn it off and turn it on again"
you've learned well
im in tech support now boi
my internet speed is still way under 1Gbps but it's consistent and usable
lol that actually fixed it mostly
like what you had me do
Do a hard reset
oh no
and the internet is awful
it just shut off randomly
ok my whole computer is fucked now
Lol yeah
they'll probably call you in the day before you have to go
And I didnt sign anything lol
Gotta send out a bunch of update emails
it's government mate
you've got it haven't you?
RIP
I havent heard from Supervisor for masters in over a month
I havent heard from PSPC about my job in months
I think my internet is fast enough to heist

It's jumping from 100 to 1.4
I just restarted into windows 😦
restart computer
lmao
1.4 Mbps
ok now it's my internet that is shit today
Are any of you lads ready for a heist
it sucks
all seasons of TV nowadays only have like 8 episodes
true
If you CAN sleep in it's harder to make yourself go to bed
But it's not as bad if you stay up late
That's true
So its better if  am alive to the world from 9am - 2pm
I mean I have shit to do, and I never do it once everyone is home and wanting to do stuff
It's harder when you don't need to get up
Haha
Sounds drastic to me, normal for you
its the only way
Ok I am going to commit to waking up at or before 9am now every week day
yep
Beat
lol
So she's got us bear for broke sleep schedules
And I don't think Brianna slept by the time I had woken up
Yes
Jesus we gotta fix it
This morning I slept through two hours of work becHse of it
But
I stopped caring so much about being in bed by 11
Aw man same kind of
then i sleep 11 hours until 2 pm
Even if I wake up earlier (8am past two days), I cant fall asleep until 3am
My sleep schedule is broken
How do you make such a poorly optimized game
Jesus Christ
it gave him a warning saying 8GB of RAM was insufficient
on smaller resolution
Shon couldnt exceed 1 fps
That doesn't sound right
Jesus
I got 12 fps on 800 x 600 resolution with all graphics settings on min
Probably well haha
tim really curious to see how well <@!136253782131474432>  can run it
yeah i guess so
Rust is terribly programmed
like pubg
one of those games that for some reason is REALLY HARD TO RUN
ok but i feel like rust is like
oh no
oh
but i just did

you son of a bitch im in
do we all have it downloaded now
<@!331154975457673228>
<@!257986741896609802>
laddies
just really boosts wifi signal range
then it repeats them as if it's the router
it is really good at picking up wifi signals
A little device you plug into an outlet
it's like
what dat
fin ima give you a wifi repeater
down by my computer
that sounds average
150Mbps
I have 400
my phone down by my computer gets 150MB
my speed says 180 right now
lmao
I'll just drive a USB with payday 2 over to both of your houses

there is nothing in my queue
but it wont start
so payday 2 is in my queue
Omg im cursed
😦
christ it was faster tucked in the corner unde rmy desk
oh strange
5Ghz weirdly isnt coming up
have you tried 5?
2.4Ghz
what wifi network are you on
I cursed it
Ffs
haha no worries
flash just glares the plastic
pic is too bad
loose
I dont think its lose
that's really bad speeds
really doubt it but
I wanna see if the internal part of the antennas came loose or something
you take a flash picture through the top glass of your computer
can
no
are you still downloading?
oh man
or switching to 5Ghz if you're on 2.4
140Kbps 🙂
switching to the other one might fix it
the 5Ghz is stronger but shorter range
do you have a 5Ghz and a 2.4Ghz network?
also
its lead plated
wifi signals are weak shit
it's very possible
its my fucking bookshelf I bet
just now
I can give you this wifi antenna the next time I see you too
I pulled it all the way out
you might have to pull it out a bit
how far into the back corner of your desk is the computer
god damnit
11 Mbps
well dont get it THAT long
Adjusted them, it got worse
someone would definitely trip over the cord lol
we have one
30 ft+

My macbook can barely run steam
I keep having to delete stuff
I'm just about capped out on my 500GB ssd
Even on my computer
STeam is fucked now
Yeah 500GB should do just fine
1 min to respond to any command
you just need a corresponding amount of SATA cables
is it just me or does steam take like
Haha

Do I have two slots?
I think Ill buy a 250GB SSD
It's not awful for games
But
But still a lot slower than SSD
true!
which is faster than over USB
fin you can install an internal HDD
will take a bit
well
i need to download it tho
Running games off the external is hell
yeah HDDs are so slow
Hahaha
I refuse to not use a SSD after using my crap 2TB external
Brianna has a 128GB ssd but stores all her games on another HDD

I need to buy a speaker too
then just put games on that
Hm I better get a job soon
Or you can order a 5TB regular harddrive for probably $50
SSDs are cheap now if you get some money I can help you get a new one
